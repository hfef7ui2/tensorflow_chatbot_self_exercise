C'esc ma tete. This is my head
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
do you listen to this crap?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Wow
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Daddy, I --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What makes you think he'll do it?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
He's pretty!
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What'd you do to her?
You makin' any headway?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Where ya goin?
Two legs, nice rack...
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
A hundred bucks a date.
Nope - just came by to chat
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Are you following me?
Like you could find one
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there --
Yes
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
You up for it?
It wasn't like that.
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
As a parent, that's my right
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
What plan?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What just happened?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
We should have seen land.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
I haven't given you much of a life.
She said yes.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
To bring the word of God.
Father Marchena!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I am listening, my son.
I have to disagree.
Do they have such thoughts?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
You must be mad...!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
I'm coming with you.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You better get packed.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Oh.
Who did cause and origin?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Any I.D.?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
What's wrong?
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Stop it.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
Are you married?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Who is he?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
How you erase this?
Why not?
Let me get a shot of it.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
You got that?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
Robert...?
Viewer discretion advised!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Well, he...
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah?  What kind?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Okay. 
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
It's about my salary cheques.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
You're kidding.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Well, don't worry about it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Five by five, Frank.
This is three years old.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
What's the matter with my place?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
You lying son of a bitch...
You got a name, cop?
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Yeah.
Luther was part of the gang?
What do you think?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
I don't give out the details.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
Just tell me about the money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
What about Luther?
We missed.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Hey, there she is...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
You okay?
Yeah...
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Yeah?
Which one pulled the trigger?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
I got to wait for a call.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Hello.
Hey, I don't believe it.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...would you like a drink?
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I don't need one.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
6... 5...
...Hi.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Don't you open your messages?
I'm not going.
It's my wife.
Apipoulai!
Love...
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
I'm so very sad.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
...Like love...
Why?... Why would you need me?
The cash man!
This is all that survived?
Have you identified it?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Welcome home.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Okay, I believe you.
I love you.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Hello?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You should have.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
A fellow investor.
That's five thousand dollars.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Is that him?
... sorry...
I figured you share information.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
What's he talking about?
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
How much did he pay you?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Keep moving.
Look, you cocksucker...
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You're making me very angry.
You're asking me why?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Remember me?
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Who is he, his name?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Pittsburgh?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
Nothing remotely like this.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Hello?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
How... how can you say that to me...?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
You alright?
We'll figure it out.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
You in a hurry?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Then you saw him, too?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
I've been working double shifts.
Not really.
Here we are.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
So?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I gotta get out of here.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Is that who you're waiting for?
The tickets.
About him?
Dad!
Where are we going?
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Alice!
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
You, too?
What is it?
Unidentified Flying Objects.
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Excuse me, Skipper---
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
You don't believe me?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
I plan to. Soon.
Oh.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
If you get it?
Double A. New Britain.
They said.
Safety on?
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
On your sleeve.
Saw him do it?
Yeah.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
What then?
It's fun.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
It's pretty old.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
That's illegal, you know.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
What's the hurry?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
How you holding up, Wade?
You and Mel Gordon?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
We should talk.
It's just...
I'm sorry about what I said.
Call me.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Alright. I'll think about it.
I know your parents.
Of course! I would've heard.
You're not using it today?
Coffee's perked.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
No shit.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Margie?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Mom?
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How you doing, sweetie?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Uh, we got a problem here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
But they start executing hostages in
Why?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Leave my daughter alone.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
The fax machines.
What's going on?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
who can I say is calling?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Felt like a large asteroid.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Can't we change course?
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Request; life support systems check.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
He's a boy dog.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
All right, it's a matter of death.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Both pilots!
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
What's his problem?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
See them, Elaine?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
You okay?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
William Harcourt?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
What is wrong?
Nothing?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Back off, George.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Who is he?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your health...
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Where'd you get this?!!
Please, I must get out here.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Uh, George...
What is this?!
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, Sykes?
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
Okay, let's do it.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Now, wait a second --
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
So.
How do you feel?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Seventeen meters.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
They're in the approach corridor.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
It's game time.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
What did you say?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
No, it's different, honey.
Gone.
Burke!  Open the door!
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Why not?
What does he look like?
Why?
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
Where?
Stop it!
Where?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Yes!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
You're not going to do this?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
Excellency!
Originals?
These are originals?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Where's our friend?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Be careful!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
I said play!
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
A-flat, Majesty.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Sire.
Why not?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Would you tell me why?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
No, really!
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Why? What has happened?
Is he working?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Leave that alone!
Put it down!
No.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Mio caro Adone.
Love, Sire!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I have come to commission work from you.
How long will you give me?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
I do.
What?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
It couldn't be simpler.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
You mean in Turkey?
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Exactly. A dance.
No, but I'm the best.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Mozart -
About what?
Leave me alone.
Well?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
But not his body.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
How did he look?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
And what else?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
It was a wolf.
Call me David.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
How old are you?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
But, David.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
No what?
Feeling better?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
I looked.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Who is this girl?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Yes.
That's a wolf's head.
Hello.
Jack, we'd better go.
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm going completely crazy.
Shut up, you zombie!
It's you, David.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
A monster. I know, I know.
Jack, are you really dead?
Because this must be stopped.
You were saying?
Excuse me.  Yes?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
I don't rightly know, sir.
Hello, Tom.
He has?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
We want to talk to you.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh!
Thanks.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Fifty thousand dollars!
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
What's this?
I'm not interested in what you think.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Much better this morning, thank you.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Yes?
Helen!
Mr. Dickson?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Well, I—
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
What time did this thing happen?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Yes, sir.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Yes.
Yes.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Dude Finlay?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
What time did you get in?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Damn!
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Thanks for the help.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
We'll make them pay for this.
Missed you, cousin.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Boys...
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
How'd it go in there?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
We're doing this for Ma.
We're drunk.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Uncle Frank?
Did you kill Yankees?
Jesse, are you awake?
You shouldn't be up.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Don't swear.
Mmm.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Was it worth it?
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
And you're too young.
You okay, Jesse?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
How can that be?
Just perfect.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
With my money!
That.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
What the hell is that sound?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
We should do it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Are you using minoxidil?
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Don't, I'll drink it.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Late?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
What is it?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Interesting.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Well...
Don't tell him you're here.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
How old are you?
Where did you go to school?
Bad habit.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
So...you hang out here a lot?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
What?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I've questioned him.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He does? You're sure?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm so hungry.
I lost my job...
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Speak up. Come on.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
You are a fanatic.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
It's important.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
Look at this.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
You look beautiful.
...What?
Milo?
Right. Wait. A toast.
That'll be a test, won't it?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Milo?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
What?
You're interfaced with our dish.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
We could move 'em up here.
Who's that?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
'Think I should buy some originals?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
This is good. Who did it?
Okay, #2.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
What're we looking for?
...Were you?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Cool!
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Do we post it on the Net?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Does he know you know?
Why?!
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Maybe it's the satellite.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
You seem surprised to see me.
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Thank you.
Yes?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Oh, and Austin...
Hello, Exposition.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
My mother's told me all about you.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Oh, yes you are.
No, did you use a condom?
Hello, luv.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Noooooooooooooo!
Oh my God, he's back.
Shut up.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Quite impressive.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
In due time.
What did you say?
How's Austin?
You didn't...
I'm proud of you.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Knight ...
... death ...
Fear ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
You
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
What are you trying to do to me?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
You.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Then what's stopping you?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I was about to throw in the towel.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Strange.
I must say, you look more your old self --
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
You followed me.
I thought you played by the rules.
No, after you.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Aren't you coming?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
You don't believe him?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Oh, hello ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Why?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You with Mother or Father?
No, please! I beg you ...
The last one you'll ever see.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
Rules are made to be broken.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
You're kidding.
And...
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Let go of me!
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Great bathing suit.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Let's go.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
What can I be doing for you?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
I'd love that.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I'm not really hungry.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
You're late again, Rick.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Wash it to the windows?
Biggest in two battalions.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- Knock it off!
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Is he...
-- He killed people --
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Brian, look --
Hey, what are you doing here?
Brian.
You're back.
I work for city hall.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
I could use a date.
You think that's really any of your business?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
I don't know anything about it.
What is --
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Where are you going?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
I don't guess.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
What?
So, you surviving without me?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
He just wants to --
They're waitin' man.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Knock it off. Now.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
It knows us. This one knows us.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
Large?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
...Benedict Arnold...
He gots to be did.
Everybody say Ho!
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
You don't have the demographics.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
I'm not smiling.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
I'm out.
No offense.
Nice to meet you.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Word!!!
The name of the show?
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
That's what I'm askin'.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
I love you too, Daddy.
How long has my father been like this?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So what's up with you?
How was it?
I'm in till the end.
You okay?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
This is the group I was telling you about.
You've said that already.
So you have your small victory, now what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
This is crazy.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
He wants you to come and see him.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
...aconite get it dat cheap.
Around...
I fell out of my bed last night.
I slept too near where I fell out.
The good stuff.
Maybe you need to start.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
How did you get this gig?
You leave something out?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Have you taken my message to him?
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I don't know.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
No.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
May I be quite frank with you?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Yeah, if you've slept.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
You saved Kendall's life --
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
What the fuck is going on?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
You know it's not like that --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
How do you know?
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
What I said before --
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Something like that. You?
You're kidding.
Something wrong?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Why do you care?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
I pushed him too hard.
We need to talk --
This isn't the time --
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
How?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Pike and I got separated --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
It won't work --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
So?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
You were expecting me?
Or are you too scared?
Can I see him?
How would you describe him?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Helping people makes me happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
When did you ever work in an office?
I thought you weren't dying.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Tell me how it happens.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
How can I convince you to stop?
I was drying out.
Were you and my father having an affair?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
It's bad.
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
I need you on my side.
How is he?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Mom?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
You know what for.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Yes.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
What?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Right.
No.
So how long will you be in England?
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
He wants a lot of money.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
What?
You don't understand me.
Are you scared?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
It's not mine.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Is the flight full?
Then start taking them seriously.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
When? Now? Oh. No.
What do you need?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
What happened?
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
You gonna steal my truck?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Better?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
YOU SHUT UP!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Don't... don't say that to me...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
You some kind'a pervert?
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
You take it straight?
Still makin' jokes?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I know that.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
You need some weed?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
He tapped that.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Heard about this morning.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
So...  That your first time?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
What?
I feel better. Do you?
What happened to your face?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just wanted some make-up.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I think she got to you, pappy.
What's this?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
This should be it...
Squid?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Are you expecting anyone?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
Why the hell not?
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
Know her?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Nick!
You did great, Ichiro.
Someone attacked him.
You all right?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't give him any more.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
They want your autograph.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
How big a package we talking about?
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
Because I want you to tell me.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Why tell me this?
If I say no?
He knows what he's doing.
Let's go while there is still time.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
But not to last.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Why are you staring at us?
Show me something?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
I want to do it.
What was he after?
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
Well, when do you get paid?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Yes?
Those cockroaches?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Why didn't you go?
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Book the good ones for where?
Yeah?
What the fuck for?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Me.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
It's artificial?
I'd take him to the doctor.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I told you I'd come back.
What do people do in the afternoon?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Well?
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
But I understand what you mean.
You want to go home?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Twenty.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
No, I'm lost.
I came on a bus.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Right.
It was amazing.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
How's that?
Why are you doing that?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Who are these people?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Because I want to get married.
I don't want to be alone.
They're all divorced?
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
When do you need her by?
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
The what?
About clothing?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Hey, Eve!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I like her.
That's ridiculous.
What?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
What?
Uh-huh. Adam?
Hi, Eve!
...I do.
No.
Is this because of the radiation?
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Like a painting?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
That's what everybody believes?
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
You have very nice ceilings.
I love Lucy!
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Who use to own it?
Not on him.
Why not? He has great pants.
The hotel.
I don't see anything!
Help you?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
No.
All back East.
He drank it hot?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Days??
Home sweet home!
Thirty -five years!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Watch this!
Calvin!
What did you wish for, Adam?
In the generator room again?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Yes.
He's smart.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
How long will you set it for this time?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Well, what do you think?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
I don't think so.
What do you want to do with it?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I don't know. I like to think so.
To get some frozen poultry.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Anything you can tell me?
Why do you do it?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Is Sandy part of this?
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Do you like talk like that?
Thank you. honey.
Then don't talk about killing.
Oh shit.
Nice guy. Who's he?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Falling.
Who is Don?
It used to make me laugh, but.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
You what?
You called me Jeffrey.
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
They hurt his head.
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, daddy.
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Well. Okay.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
No, you're right.
Hi Dad.
Are you feeling okay?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Okay, yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Oh yeah?
You like mysteries that much?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
Probably not. No. Why?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
There's ways around that.
Are ya ready?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Anybody see ya?
What the fuck are you doing?
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Hey Murphy?
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Nervous?
So what do you think?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
So, what do we do now?
What?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
The what man?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Who the...
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Right now.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hello?
Roc. You okay?
Worst day of my life, man.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Hello? You there?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Yes.
I guess not.
You're right.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
This is he?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Where are you going?
Did you see that?
I'm lookout.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
It had an alarm.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Holy shit.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Why not?
I'll just say it.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Inez, this is --
She's from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
I think we better go home.
I'm not. But there's --
We've got sixteen dollars.
Sixteen dollars.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What time did he say to be here?
Dignan. Take it easy.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Do you like Inez?
Yeah. As a girl.
You're all clear.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Where's Kumar?
What?
What'd he get?
Why?
You're living on a sailboat?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
That was a test?
Did Dignan take the test?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Are you afraid?
Absolutely.
Let them fight.
See you.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Give him a second.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Yeah.
That's Anthony.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I think we might of scared her.
I paid for it.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
This is natural.
How much is there?
Way to go, Bob!
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
What the fuck possessed you?
What do you mean get back?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Just get in the car, Bob.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Dignan.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Come on!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I couldn't hear anything.
The elevator broke.
Do you have your own room?
Do they let you --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Join the party, fellas.
You like Chicanos?
How's the weather down there?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I want to know what happened.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
May I finish?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Sit down.
Why not? It was just money.
She say what time I should call?
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
You know I'm not.
I have to go now.
So why didn't you kill me then?
Pamela Landy?
-- what? --
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
So...
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I did.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
You hear me? I believed you.
Say it.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
That's a lie!
Why am I alive?
We need to get in there.
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
What kind of problems?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Did you?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Wallace has sacked York!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
You know it's a trap.
That's just a dream, William!
Keep these. We're going too.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You'll move
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
I have faced him. Have you?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Did it work?
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Tonight then.
I need you so much! I love you!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I am the Princess of Wales.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Why did you?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I don't know. These things take time.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Dad lives here?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Oh God... what did we do?
Ouch.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Where... where are my clothes?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Ha! Where's that?
There's one major hole in your story.
Where are we going?
And...?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Smells like sex in here.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Destroy it?
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to me good, Evan...
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Lung cancer?
Lenny? Come on!
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick, I --
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Hello, Rick.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Please.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
How did you get in?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Yes.
It's been a long time.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
When will he be back?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Your work.
Good evening.
Had a close one, eh?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
I understand.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I believe you have a message for him?
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Even in Berlin.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
It was a combination of all three.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Yeah, you were saying?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I have. Sit down over there.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Where were you last night?
Give me another.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick! Rick, help me!
He'll double what I pay you.
No. Not me, boss.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Nobody remembers that.
Get up.
No more water, you said.
No.
You're putting off the inevitable.
What are you doing?
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
It's real.
You know what happened to this?
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
You?  Personally?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Four four.  A record.
You know, for when you travel.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
I have to.
"We're" not over-reacting.
That's your dog.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
There was a coffin?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Come on.  Try.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
Kamal is not here.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
You fucked us over.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
Forget it.
That's why you're a gambling man.
I beat the odds!
Hello.
Cool ropes.
That's what it's about.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
How many months are you?
Where's Mandalay?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
A movie *outside*?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
You don't understand! It's her father...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Stop it! Just cut it out!
I know, I'm sorry.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Do you think she'll be all right?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
That's true.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
What's a nanny do?
Uh... it's the end of October.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
What kind of plane are you flying?
Liberator...
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
What's that? What's it called?
I'm stayin', Homer.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
What's that?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
We had to finalize the deal.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Keeping the Fix happy.
Nice.
You're a superstitious fucker.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
You know what we're doing with the money.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
She up for this?
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Jake --
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Sorry, I --
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
What about... The money?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Says who?
You need to get a haircut.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
We're working for the King.
Why?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
What do we do? We change the scam?
And we got rid of the red head.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
What happened?
Sorry. What?
Speak.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Special Agent?
Who?
Peace of mind.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
You trust this Moonan guy?
Three years, two months. March '93.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Last hand.
I get it.
Good night?
And your lady?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
How's that football story corning along?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
I want to hear it.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
The door, Jack.
That girl, she works at the casino --
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
So how are you doing, dad?
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
Near the casino.
How did you hurt your hand?
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
What happened?
Which side do you like?
I'm in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I want you to forget what I said.
Yes.
Would you like a drink?
Jani! Where are you?
How are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
I'm Lucy.
Where to?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Where did you go to school?
You use two alternating, don't you?
Where's the magnet?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
That hair will have to go.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Thanks.
Hey, bomb...
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
That's it.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Wha?
I need a diameter approximation.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Men... men... what happened, men?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
What?
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Can I say something in my defense?
Lemme put some clothes on.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Where'd you clip this?
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
You're light a deuce.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
Who is...
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
So what are you gonna do about it?
The other one like you...
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
You said you could help.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
What do you want?
Who are you?
I think you should go now.
Thank you.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
A little what?
A long time.
Only one I can think of.
Not right now.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
What happens if you level with her?
And why should she?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
You love him?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
I-I c-can't...
No problem.
We've got to take this slow...
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
What the fuck!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
I think we should try sneaking in.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Cool.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
I got...
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
But we took the keys?
Two hundred bucks?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Good morning, mongrels!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
I feel bad for his family.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Beg pardon?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Who is... we?
You have a request?
How old is Grandma Death?
Hey...
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Where are we going?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
What happened to your neck?
We're moving through time.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Hey.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Grandma Death.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Where are you going?
Cellar door.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
So, I met a new friend.
I think he saved my life.
Follow him where?
Do you think a lot about girls?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Yes. I went to jail.
That I did it again.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Then how is time travel possible?
I can see him right now!
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Rose.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Kitty...
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
What is wrong with you?
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Loretta, don't do that.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Mrs. Leeman?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Amber...
Oh shit!
Ow!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
That's it, I'm goin'...
C'mere. I love you so much.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
And the year before that?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
And wear a crown and everything.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Here I am, Father...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Half watch dog?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
No, but I shot some ducks.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
It must be done right away.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Then it's war?
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
Did it go well, darling?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
What do you mean?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Good! How is the patient?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Good day...!
Oh, no.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
How awful for John.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Righteousness for his namesake.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
WHAT did you say?
WELCOME?
WHY?
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Do you believe I love you?
The second note.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
How do we know this is the way?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Is there nothing men can do?
How?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
No. 
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Why should you care?
What are you talking about?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Let's hack her to pieces.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
Row!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
You need to say a bit more than that!
Well, what else do we do?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
How did he do that?
Vanish into thin air?
You know, my son, our lord said...
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Get away, Snorri.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
And I just liked you so much.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I don't have one.
I can't remember.
I'm sure you would.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
It's okay.
Where do you live?
Take care.
Um --
It's pretty.
No. I --
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yo ho ho!
I don't think we're ready.
So, um --
What if you hide me?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I dropped you off after. You said --
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You know what I did.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
It's true.
Hi, it's Joel.
I just got in.
It was snowing.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
So then she just stops calling.
How's the chicken?
Naomi.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
How was it?
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Definitely!
Stan... c'mon...
It's stopped.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
No way. I can handle this.
What do you want, Stan?
What's this?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
What, Howard?
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Well, where was Patrick?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
The voltage looks fine.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
But I don't know how to polka.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
A traveler, eh?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
That's Jellybean!
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Whooee!
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Holy shit...
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
What is it?
Please... kill...
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
...I don't want to die...!
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
What does it say?
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Any survivors?
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
If it worked.
What about it?
Explanation?
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Where has it been for the past seven years?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Your eyes...
Weir is dead.
It is now.  We're locked in.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Thank you.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It tastes bad.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Miller...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Miller, come in...
What?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
He served on the Goliath.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
No. I saw nothing.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
Hey...
The safety circuit's failed!
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
A straight line.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Claire is your wife?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What are you doing here?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
What about his first born?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
The shields on the station should protect us.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Then what is it?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Which was?
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What's going on?
You said it was urgent.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
You're a really good kisser.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Oh. Hi.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Hey, Rat.
Yo.
Damone, are you there?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
My brother's car!
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
That's him! He did it!
How's it going.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Was it great?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Where's Doug?
But what are you going to do?
Dartmouth?!
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Thanks for picking me up.
I think I better take you home.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
...I've got to go home.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Rum and ice, please.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
...and we're chock full of that!
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Why?
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
Can we make it?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Where'd you get that knife?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Jesus.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Lucy.
Read the newspapers.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
May I see your license.
I will not die because of him!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
Where are you two going?
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
I don't think you should...
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
We'll be food, dickheads!
And that's how I ended up here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
You all sure about this?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
My husband...
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Huh?
What do you mean what?
What's going on between you two?
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I'll go with ya.
What?!
SHIT.
Yeah, maybe.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Go! Go!
Get to your cars!
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Frances?  Oh no.
What're you doing?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
What does Clifford say?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
...I see.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Were you an alcoholic?
Bye, baby.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
I'm going back to the hotel.
Name?
Address?
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Just one minute...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Well? What'd you think?
What?
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
You're telling me.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
There's just one more thing.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Pretty morning.
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
I live here.
What?
'But how do I know you love me?'
Mama...
But they're using you!
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
...Did you really say that?
This whole thing is a joke!
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
What?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Symington says...
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
Nice.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
What can I do?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
He always was opinionated.
Have you seen Willie?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Victor. I love you,
What sort of task?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Brother and sister no more.
A warming wind.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
I was just clearing my throat.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Only you would think of that!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Professor Waldman.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
How is it you come to be here?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
How come you're leaving?
Filmmaker.
Trouble?
Help you clean up?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
I'm sorry.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Give me a hand?
You saved my life.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
What hath God wrought?
Ow!
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Anything else you want?
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
You said it was just you and your son.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Yeah, follow us.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Why do you want to stop?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Where is the little lady?
You're a preacher?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
I promise.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
Do you believe me?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Are you okay?
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Hot goddamn day!
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
They're gonna search the van.
This ain't the time, Richard.
You okay?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
The woman I saw you with...
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
No, sir, WHAT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Permission to leave, sir?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Shit.  Think we're had.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Time.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
The Navy Cross...
I was looking for him earlier, but...
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
So dump on me.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
That bad?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
So why are you telling me this?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Do you, uh, know...
'Cool?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Clear.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
You okay?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
And you think this creature is one of them?
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
You never said it was off the record.
Circuits are overloaded.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Can I use some?
Did you talk with Humphries?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
What sample?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
You gave them the tape?
It's the French Secret Service.
We know.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
At ease men.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
About this much.
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
He's a twit!
What the hell is going on?!!?
What's happened?
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
We heard it the first time!
"Go into the cloud! ...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
You said "the Commander.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
How did you come to that conclusion?
No, wait, are you-
Go. They're off again.
Structural damage at 68 percent.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Systems register functional.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
They're still behind us...
It's... I don't know.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
Hi everybody.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're alive!
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Are they behind us?
Can it be repaired?
What?  What did he say?
You're kidding. When for?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Yes.
We.. We lie.
Weapons storage...
A model, only as big as this.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Anything.
Okay... On what?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Well, George, who were you?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I'm so inclined.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
Sir, I think no such thing.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
General Lee is detained captain...
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Colonel Reed...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
That's right...
Not today.
But, you do come from a military family?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Well, this must be about something!
George, you know I only love you, but...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
What are you doing?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
You see the paper?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
She's... young.
That's all there is to it, huh?
Karen? You okay?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
I don't know.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Hello? You there?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
How'd you get in here?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
You pack a gun?
One of his best parts.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Just a thought.
You don't even know these guys.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
You've been losing.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
We call you a taxi.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You don't act like it?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
How did you get in the house?
Harry -–
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Oh, for Christ's sake –-
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
What is your first name?
You think that's funny
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Smokes?
If you get it back in one piece.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Bodies're too fresh.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Don't fall asleep.
Morning everybody.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
You sure it wasn't me?
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The ah... the radio's out.
What do you think happened on this boat?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
What now?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Pretty low all around.
Oh, man.
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
It's a Noaa buoy.
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What about the gold?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
I thought you say Tuesday.
No, no. You got leak.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Give up?
Maxine.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Are you still looking for a job?
About what?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And what can you tell us about this... 
Did you actually do this painting?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
So Josh...
I just stopped in to say hi.
Nothing.
Oh, hi...
Okay... I promise.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
What? Why?
Hi.
Much later.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
Does Oomie really like this show?
What does it stand for?
I want to "make love" to him.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
What was that all about?
I didn't get it either.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
You won't believe it! Guess!
That guy is totally amazing.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Look, we have to get these...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Hello?
What happened to Seymour?
Just some people from work...
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Hi... what's your name?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Yes, that would certainly do...
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What are you doing here?
What's the matter?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
What about Joe?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Talk to us about it...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Seymour?
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
I'll be bait alone?
How many do you think they've killed?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Did it look like this in your mind?
Where is it?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Where do you go next?
What do you want with my baby?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Can I help you?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Well, good night, Louis.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
You've got to do something!
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
What now, Brainiac?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
Pretty impressive, huh?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Who, Ray?
What's that?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
What kind of tests?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Does it have any favorites?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
And pure --
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
That's too bad.
I want to help you.
Great rehearsal.
You're the best one in your row.
Can't you tell me now?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
That is one speedy mutt.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
In the physical sense.
I want you to have this. 
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And may I see this storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Where's the Keymaster?
What now?
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Set entry grid.
I told you it's real.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
So do I.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Do you believe in God?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Don't you think you should at least wave?
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I am their hero!
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Caesar, ignore them.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
So am I.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Where is my father?
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
The Senators admire you.
As soon as I can.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
He's very realistic.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
How much money is involved?
Then get a large cash advance.
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you always drive like this?
Do you want some dinner?
Why not?
Where is the car?
Is anything wrong?
Where we going?
What is the matter?
Did they ever find out?
All right.
Yes.
What is it?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
-- really incredible --
Why?
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben!
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Are you listening?
What are you then?
You're not one of those agitators?
What for?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Is it a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Will you take me home?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Drink?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Her portrait?
No.
Thank you.
What?
May I sit down?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Thank you.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
What?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
How do you get out of the house?
Always?
We're talking.
Right.
But you don't hate him.
Well I can't.
And you were a student also.
At college.
What was your major?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
No.
Good.
I have my reasons.
But it's not.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Mrs. Robinson --
I don't believe you.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Nothing else.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I'm just --
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I know.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Now look -- please --
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Is anything wrong?
I don't believe it.
Have you a minute now?
I want to speak --
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
How?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Like dancing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
I'd given you up.
Why?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
You live here?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
No?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
And now?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Why later?
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Why?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Is that too much, Baron?
All right then.
That was my last.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
And the child isn't coming?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Any letters?
Oh!
Oh -- but -- I --
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
I'm engaged for the evening.
You dance splendidly.
Really?
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Yes, of course, -- money!
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Baron!
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
All right.
No water -- What a place!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
I know you did -- I said you did --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
You see -- what we are interested in --
You're a deep one.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Good morning, Pimenov.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
You're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Next week.
What's bluff?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Pretty as a picture.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You're calling the shots.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
You're a thousand percent right!
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Right in front of the room.
Want a look?
I certainly hope not.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Here you are! Two rich people!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Kaggs. Home office.
Sounds like a good Idea.
Perk, remember?
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
I like those.
Not as tough as you, huh?
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Why?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
No.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Roy?
Roy? It this all we have?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Get well soon.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
What?
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
Atascadero.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
What?  What for?
You -- I don't know.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
Roy Dillon?
I realize this is a shock.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
I'll be damned.
Carter.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
A dead body?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit?!
You're twisted.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Still wants to move out?
Keri, you all right?
Look, they're staring right at us.
Better her than me.
You're so easy...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Is Tim there?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
What if your parents come home?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Mommy, I'm scared.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
God ... this can't be true.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Where are you going?
What now?!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
What is that?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
You've created a monster.
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
At least we found the diamonds.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Months?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Otherwise, how are things?
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Go to the funeral?
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
Hi, Penelope.
Is Penelope in?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Insurance!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Fifty years?
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
We got to get another pilot.
Ask it!
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
College!
No.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad--
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
"Hamburger Heaven."
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
What do you do for a living?
Some kind of animal?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
Your old beau?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Now that's what I call fun.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Now--turn around, if you would.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Breakfast?
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
That's what you're supposed to say.
It couldn't!
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
No you don't.
No.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
We have, have we?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're a son of a bitch.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
I see.
What is this thing that kills me?
Can't do it.
What are you going to do?
Leave the rifle here.
And you went home unannounced, too?
What happened?
So long, you guys.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Something's made you sore.
What's this?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
I know.
He's a ghost!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
A what kind of doctor?
Not true.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I don't really know.
That's why I'm crying.
What are his symptoms?
What does he say to do?
We don't have a maid any more.
I hate that thing.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I see.
Is he all right?
Did you talk to Paul?
What was it?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
It's true.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
We made the date three months ago.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
What kind of a life is that?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
No, I don't.
What?
What do you mean?
I'm getting angry.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Are you sure it's all right?
Joanne?
Where's he?
I thought you were going to bed?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
Of Joanne's?
And your wife? Where's she?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
Say what?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Why do you say that?
Did you find out where she was?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
You are.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Yeah. Probably.
But this is my apartment.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
I don't know.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
You're talking about real excitement?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Jake.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Com'on, tell me.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Was he with a girl?
And what are you studying?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Could I see your registration?
Okay, lady. Out.
But there is a family resemblance.
Officer, I can explain.
Yes.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
How about some ginger pie?
You don't look eighty.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why do you say that?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What happened?
What were you fighting for?
Okay?
I think he's following us.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Look at the stars.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Why?
... which I hope will make you very happy.
"And this too shall pass away."
Is Sunshine your real name?
And a lot of time.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Well, I didn't.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Frank.
Yes... Yes. You look...
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
No bad dreams.
O.K. Let's go.
I... remember.
Who?
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
The freak in the gas mask --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
What the hell was that? An ape?
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Don't look! Turn around.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Sir, may I go first??
That voice --
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Thank you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Well good n-
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Goodnight, then.
Out? Out out?
You're going alone?
It's freezing, isn't it?
Yes, I --
Christ!
Lucky man.
Nobody escapes us.
Please listen to me --
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
Well can I come in or not?
Well?
Wedded bliss?
Don't look at me.
Help me.
What happened to you?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Well?
Later.
A long time.
This is what began it.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe we should just leave --
There's a towel in the bathroom.
What happened?
No, damn you --
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
No argument.
Where are you?
You're NOT going to faint.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you all right?
Maybe a brandy.
Oh baby.
I suppose that's right.
I suppose not.
Kirsty?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
You'd like the house.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I have to talk to you.
He's gone.
No you don't.
You're not going?
Need any help?
Not that late.
Meaning what?
I beg your pardon?
Are you busy after work ?
These THINGS... they want to take me --
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
We'll do it next Monday.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Isn't it?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Like fuck you are.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
That's what I said.
He's got one!
Don't do it, Rob!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Rob.
What is this.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Can I help you?
I dunno.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
But don't you remember?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
What?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Is it better?
Never?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You know I'm a good person.
Don't forget your CDs.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Look, are you coming or not?
You're soaking.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
More confident, maybe.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Barry said its done.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
What are you going to talk to me about?
So?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
So you'll stay?
Which way are you going?
That way.
I'll call you.
Yeah?
And after that?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
What do you think?
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
I warned you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
No.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
This is against the rules.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'd rather hear yours.
No.
No.  I had to talk to you.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
You're using your son's name.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it you want?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
All fashionably without heads.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
-Et lux perpetua-
Be quiet.
Afternoon.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
But we cannot be killed.
How can I stop such a man?
Why?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I'm your future husband, remember?
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Who am I deceiving?
Not so scared.
Finish your prayers?
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Equals?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
We must talk.
Do not turn your back on me.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
How are you?
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
Long time.
Friend of yours?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
We have some unfinished business.
I want you to come to me.
Did you know the victim?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
Nothing to be sorry about.
Are you back?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Too hot?
All right, dear.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
What do you want?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Done what?
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Allow me.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Now you're talking!
What do you think I am -- a crook?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Hildy!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Railroad tickets.
Double-crossing swine!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
What happened?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Hello -- hello...
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
In a way.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Well -- what is it?
Where'd you wire him?
Sure.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What!
How about Bruce's?
Hildy, darling!
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Who locked the door?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
So have we!
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
What a chase!
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Where'd you get this?
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
What went off?
Just one second --
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Shoot to kill, I said.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Where's the old lady?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Who is it?
There goes another scrub lady.
Look out, you --
You know it is!
Mother!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother!
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
For heaven's sake, why not?
But how do I know...?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Get out of here!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What's he want?
Can I try?
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Give him the you-know-what.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Do you know any swear words?
Sod.
You're the biggest fibber.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Boy, that was some air-raid.
What is it?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What about it?
Except the servicemen.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
We don't know anything about it
Well?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
What did I do to deserve this?
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
I'd like to see that.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
How long have you been running this place?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
She looks like she stinks.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Fuck! We are fucked!
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
Fine. I'll go straight.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
And...
Is that all... think real hard.
Fascinating.
Goddamn.
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Fuck, it's freezing.
So what?
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
How long has it been?
I don't hear anything.
Oh, right.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Where is he?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Well hello, officer.
Please, just a minute.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Jesus Christ.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Plates match.
Over.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
You decide. Today is your day.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Well?
That's not how he tells it.
You were wonderful!
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Very well.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
So?
My brother says he likes you, too.
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Rose, please go away.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's perfect!
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Bravo to you, Puff!
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
You were gone a long time.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Oh boy!
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
No, why?
Mother?
I'll make it up to you.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
We'll be there.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
How much do I owe you?
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Pool.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Sure.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I wanna walk.
Tell her what?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
How much we got?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
HOW MUCH?!
Yeah, that's what I think.
That's right. When?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You better not miss, friend.
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
You don't look like a college girl.
What do you do on the other days?
Fifth of scotch?
Why?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Don't you ever cook anything?
Give it to me.
Who is it?
He knows. A lot.
He's a gambler.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
What do you want to tell me?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Very good shot.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You name it.
I only protect myself -- !
Mine.
I don't know.
That's who you are too, Emma.
Emma...
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I surrender --
Is the hill ours too?
There are more this year than last.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
Where's your car?
I'm home now.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
We were having a little talk.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Where, Jimmy?
I swear it was here.
No.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
You're looking for life?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
What the hell is this?
Then what?
You still got the Olds?
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You try Martin?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
With their shields down it might be possible.
How do you know?
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed!
Stevie... I can't...
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
How' he doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
How's the head?
Marcus!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Schneider?
Are you expected?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
The Ark of the Covenant.
What's that?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
My room!
Uh-huh.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
All I have to do is squeeze.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Dad, are we hit?!
Those people are trying to kill us!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Where's my father?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
This is your last chance.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
What?
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Dr. Jones.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
Indy, look!
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
What does it mean, Indy?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
That's far enough!
I like the service here.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
India...
What'd he say?
What do you mean -- how?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
What'd he say now?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Can you move your arm?
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
What about the future?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
He's afraid of something.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Oh no -- oh no!!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
What?
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I get it!
I said something.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Your name is Al...
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Do me a favor, Al.
My place, can't you see?
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Who are you?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Anyone there?
Behind us?
What do I do?
I want out.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
What do you mean we.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
Door's locked.
Corridor A.
Black suits and helmets.
I'm back.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
...and a license to kill...
Eating sushi?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
She doesn't seem to understand.
What?
.
Without your pants.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Yeah. I did it.
But what's it look like?
Much too blue.
They both look good to me.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Joe, be careful!
What Happened?
You been had. We have.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
What?
He was with Gruner!
haka xuki.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
You just got a Mickey.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I didn't do anything.
What kind of a deal?
Impossible.
Me.
You've cut your hair?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Al Viola.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
You may not remember things.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Right.
Fine. You look fine.
Well...
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Why would we want to hurt you?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Yes...What is it?
What?
Oh...and who is it!?
...Blake
I waited for you.
Can I help?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why?
Who did?
Then why are you smiling like that?
What's Gruner like?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Where what?
Why'd you ask him.
I know the territory.
Why not?
What did you tell them?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't worry.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You can't take that.
This the only spare?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
It'l take months.
Hi, honey.
Yeah? What for?
What does that do?
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
You're exaggerating!
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That computer has everything...
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hi, baby.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Lowell?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What's wrong?
Yeah...
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Lowell.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
How much would I get paid?
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
...okay.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Why?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I told the truth!
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
What about now?
What's happening?!
Just give me an example...
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object to the form of the question!
Object!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
No!
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Why in God's name would I want...?
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
I'm happy for you, pal.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
I begged you to have a baby!
I assume this is on Rex?
Not yet.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He's passionate.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Yes? Marylin?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
Hmmm...
And here I thought my mother was...
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Honey, I could sit...
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Who's that?
Who's she?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Every week --
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
So what?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
That's delusional.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
And it's good!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
What's Kirshner?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Extinguish?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
Mr. Warne?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
I might.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You only met him once .
I knocked several times.
Who is he?
Peter Warne! 
Why should she? After all—
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Why; naturally, I—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
We've done that already.
What happened?
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
I beg your pardon!
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
No. I'd rather you didn't.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I never thought of that.
Here, boy!
Now, just a minute—you can't—
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like what?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
King—King Westley was in it.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I better go over and see her.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Aren't you afraid of me?
This isn't "piggy-back."
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
What!
But what!
Really?
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
What'd you give him for the car?
What about money?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Better go back to your bed.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Where's the bus to New York?
Eight o'clock tonight.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
Yes—if he is your husband.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Up yonder. See the lights?
Get out of here!
Huh?
You're drunk.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Mebbe.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Then—you'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Huh?
What's the idea?
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
I can use a smart guy like you.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
What was his voice like?
And Oswald?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Why?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
You still questioning any Cubans?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Are we going away, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
I'm not sure I understand.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Who?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Are they?  Why would they?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
But then you told her you were home.
I understand.
You were there for me.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
How'd you know where he was?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Help yourself.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Help us do what?
You don't want much, do you?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Is it dark?
What have they told you?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
If you're having some.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Somebody loan it to you?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
My ass ain't the same.
Does something else worry you?
Catching a movie.
"American President"
And Annette's it for you?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I see.
Has he hinted around?
He tries to act cool.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
What do you do when he comes home?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
What if he checks it?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
He's liable to shoot you.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Wanna go?
If I don't cooperate?
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Oh, so now you know him?
Not yet.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I'm waiting for the phone.
What were you two fighting about?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He said he didn't know about it.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You already knew that?
Are you getting that black suit?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
I understand woman, damn!
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
The Cockatoo Inn.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
Can you cover that?
Who?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
How long?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
You're fourteen years old here?
Were you a disco girl?
So where did you go?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
Did you ever go I one?
About five years ago.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Please.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Whatcha watchin'?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
What did he do?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
Couldn't talk to her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
What'd you shoot her with?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
I'm going out for a few hours.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
It still sounds high.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
What's up with this shit.
You still there?
I'm alone.
Well, give it to me then.
This place stinks.
She was afraid.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
He's around.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy!
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
Short? It's ended.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Hey, wait!
Don't go.
I am.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I had this weird flash just then.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
No.  I see them.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
The room!
Where'd you leave 'em?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I must have been out of my head.
What?
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
You okay?
We're at Della's.
Why? What for?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
Remember that.
It's just me.
Who else were you expecting?
How?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Jake, what is it?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
This isn't happening.
Goddamn you!
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
How was Palm Springs?
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
He's burning up.
Push 'em back.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
I'm sorry.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
On top of him?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
I don't have all day, kid.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
It's locked!
What's that?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Can we blow it with just two?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
You see that?
We're not supposed to do that.
Kay-Em!
Goodbye, my love.
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Earth II.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Jesus what the hell is that?
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Outta here?
Rizzo, he's out there.
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
That's why I'm here.
See? We're not so bad.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Well?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Kaboom.
I'll help you in.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
What do we do?!!
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Sorry, sorry.
Something's wrong.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
What good will that do?
Guys, please come with me!
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
What have you done?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
You got it?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Did you get him in the head?
He's trying to sink us!
Be careful.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Only 24 hours!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
How can you tell?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
You all right?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I hope we get some more help.
What's that, a ship?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
What day is this?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
Look at him take it!
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Yep.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
I'll drink to your leg.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
Really? What are they like?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
You know it's okay.
I try really hard, actually...
Wizard!
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Can we make out now?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Nails? Really?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Cool it.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
When was this, like '96?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Oh.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Uh, thanks.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
You do?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Then what's going on?
What...
Oh my God...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Who is the kid?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I sort of already have.
Or...
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Aha! You love him.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You guys are playing music?
Juno, what's the matter?
She answered our prayers.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Is it hard to learn?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What if they're dangerous?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
...I don't know.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Tight fit.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
So what do you do Early?
Can't hurt.
This the book your writing?
Now why is that?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie... stop it.
Any word from that gallery?
Nervous?
...Need a hand with those bags?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
What happened?
His Parole Officer.
What do you think?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Did she suck your dick?
You thirsty?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
Right.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper, where is he?
You goin'?
You sure?
Sup. Sup.
Yeah. Come on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Why?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Come dance.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Yeah.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Miss, would I be prying?
Your a real philosopher.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Do you know where he went?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I hate 'em.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
What's that supposed to mean?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
Morpheus.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
How is she?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Ready for round two?
To get your attention.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
You'll find her.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Why her?
Have you any idea what the message is?
What?
What word did you leave last night?
Hello, Peter.
Please... wait.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Now what?
You might not have done it had you known.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
You mean, no prints but hers?
What do you think he did?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
That's it?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Did you send the car?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
I'm just curious.
No.
I tried again and got through.
Peter, you have to admit--
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Because I know what it says.
You're right.  The killer told me.
I'm not nervous.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
We're almost married.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Have they harmed you?
In the Arctic ice.
They have Lyssa!
The White Castle has fallen.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
From here, I must go alone.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Each to his fate.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And where do you lead, boy?
When did you last sleep, boy?
Well, I'm not impressed.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Go. I command you.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Put me down, you lout!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
He will not!
Freylag's stronghold?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
It is the time.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Few have survived it.
Kegan!
I was beautiful then.
She bore you many children?
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
What's that man's name?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Why can't I have a bank account?
Wow! It's brilliant!
The yellow and pink.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
Poor darling, and then?
...Don't you drink?
...No...
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
May I ask you a personal question?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Don't fear.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...Who sent you?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
It's impossible.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Nothing's going to happen.
What steps do we take now?
I know what you're getting at.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What it is -- is the truth.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Why there?
From where?
Most certainly.
That's a reasonable assumption.
What's his story?
Red flags man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Shit!  He jumped!
I thought you were asleep.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Perhaps there's another route?
What happened?
Are you firing me?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Phileas Fogg?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
What do your friends call you?
... My father.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
How are you feeling?
Water?
Are you working?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
You're pretty drunk.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
I guess I do too.
What's up?
You OK?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Me neither.
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Hi!
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
What do you mean?
Please!
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
What did they look like?
How'd this happen?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
But it's a top three school --
What alibi?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
What?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
No!
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Why the hell not?
What did you see when you entered the house?
Was she carrying a weapon?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
Yes?
-- his life?
After you went to all that trouble?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
I'm a bitch.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Here. You're gonna need this.
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Aside from that.
But maybe it's not what you think.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
She's not!
How can you still believe she's innocent?
I can't.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Oh, my God!
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
East coast people are different.
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Pink ones.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
She's naked.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Let's all go! Road trip!
We come watch... we come watch...
We go out, smash 'em now?
Birdies... pretty...
We watch... good fun...
More fun win battle?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Protection?
Yes?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
No, wait... please... listen...
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
You be our guest, Jack.
Don't you know?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Why not mine the damned walls?
Water doesn't burn...
There isn't much time!
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Will you explain what's going on?
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
A good day for singing...
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
We seek to undo the curse.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
These for me?
But you did... you did!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
I detest serpents.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
What have I done?
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Honored to make your acquaintance.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Sigurd's sword...
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
This is not the time for squabbling.
And charmed, of course.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
The fastest in the world.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Sorry, Jack.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
You're with us in battle.
Is he a friend, then?
Simple as that, eh?
Are you going to see Sam again?
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
What's that for?
Red.
I put him to work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
My keys.
You're a good girl.
Hey.
You should stay.
He's a freak.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I'm coming in.
Why are you so uptight?
Josh said...
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
You hate your father.
He's at work while I'm here.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Stevens?
Oh, yes.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I've been here twenty years.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Is Alyssa home?
Sam?
Thanks for the shower.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
I'm not going!
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
You'll have money when you work.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Did you got through my pants?
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
What would you like to be?
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I gave up on you.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I would have killed him.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
What would you do?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
You should lock your doors.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
He never answers.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
I was parked in day parking.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
Last time you were gone for a week!
It makes me sad.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
It's been a while.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
Don't move!
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
What the fuck?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
No.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Hey.
The door was open.
She's doing just fine.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yeah.
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I got it... boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Can't you remember your own name?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
That's right, a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
You're soft.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
What ain't there?
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
You get ketchup?
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
What?!
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
What'd you say?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
How you doin'?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
How about some steak sauce?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
So it don't exist.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Mama?
What are you doing here, mama?
I can't take that, mama.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Appreciate it.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
What are you in for, Willie?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
What's Nicky doing down there?
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
This is baloney!
Knock, knock.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
You're a good devil, Dad.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
There's our man.
Looking for the chief.
This don't look good.
Please. You got to.
You gotta kill yourself.
Adrian?
You think I'm a tourist?
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
You have a dog? What kind?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Don't do it.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Off limits.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
That's better.  How do you want us?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
What's going on, Logan?!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
About running, dying what?
And then you killed him, right?
They're like beasts. Wild.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
How long have you been living here?
How did you get here?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You want somethin'?
You okay, man?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
Have you partied with him?
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Are you my man?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Yeah.
What night is that?
What's up?
The police called us.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Where's Pete?
We saw you that night, Pete.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Who is it?
No.
What's your axe?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
What's bothering you, Madison?
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
It must be from a real estate agent.
From the club. You didn't answer.
Let's go home.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Who is this?
What's goin' on?
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I didn't know you cared.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Good morning, Lovey.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Is it?
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
No kidding?
Have I?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Hey, what's happened to you?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
Oh, yes.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
When was all this?
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
He's dead.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What's she got to do with it?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
You say the porters are waiting for us?
The clothes?
What about the others?
was saying—
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Where were you hiding?
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
Was this your idea?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
The hell were you thinking?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
It'll make sense later?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
You do?
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
What?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
what's this?
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Jesus Christ...
He's here to help!?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Did he say where?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
They're gone.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Wally!
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
The other two will die without me.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
She grew up.
About who?
John?  What is it?
From where?  D.C.?
You made those tapes...
Victim's a white female.
Hence the expression...
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
We can't grab it...
The mall?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Why did you catch that?
To them.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
She spoke to me.
Are you reading my mind right now?
I forgive you.
I was looking for you...
Sean, wait...
Do you know who I am?
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What's so funny?
What?
You said they're destroyed.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
We could have lunch together.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Cream and sugar.
It was nobody's fault.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Yes, sir.
What, sir?
As far as...?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
It's daytime.
What's wrong, baby?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's your record at?
What's up? Jess ready?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
When's it going down?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Where's Ricky?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
There won't be a next thing.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
'Trustafarians?'
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Taken care of?
We're with Ruiz.
Fuck them.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
It's ours.
I'll get the girl.
C'mon, man...
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Nothing else.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
So is this the drop?
He woulda told us right?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Where do you think you're going?
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
C'mon...
Kinda. Yeah.
Yeah. I want it.
You want to come splash around.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Don't drag my ass into this --
Ow, shit...
I'm half Irish.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
Coke?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
So you're our own private guy?
I call 'em wiggers.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Keys.
I get it.
We're square.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
No...
Who's gonna outfit us?
The Red Dragon.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I am.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
It hit?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Man, what do you want?
You ain't lying.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
I can't make out that shit.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Is the program ready?
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I'm in Detroit.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I'll be away a lot.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Dear heart, where are you?
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
If you want to tell me.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
And like a fool I believe it.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
I better not come in.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
That ain't bad.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
They talked about me like
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
[Reina Rosas.]
[Daniel.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[What money?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Please, don't...]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
Is it loaded?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So what's wrong?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
What are you doing here?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Creasy?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
No.
Do you think he'll come back?
Do you always sleep with him?
Why do you ask?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
Be a swimmer.
You're American.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Jordan!
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
I like him, Mom.
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
He's not a cop killer.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
I'll call her up.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Are you kidding?
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Hey! What are you doing here?
Who?
When was this?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
It pains that they should do this.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
This is the kitchen.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
No...
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
What?
Are you kidding?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Hello, Ma.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
So I'll die without a son.
I said, is she Italian girl?
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...and they sit down right next to me...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
On accounta...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Where?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Wisconsin.
Us. Lead us not into...
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
What's that?
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
When will he be able to write?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
We think the same way.
I was just asking...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Radar!
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Black capsule.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
But I'm married.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
He's coming to.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
I have not understood what you means.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
What's going on? Who started this?
Yes, that's what I mean.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Did you get it, too?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Oh. Yeah.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Can I help you pack?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Did you write this?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Hello?
That's good.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Who, for instance?
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Have you seen him?
Had any schooling?
What do you do when you work?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Grubbel's here. See? 
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
How could he be a fake? 
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Is there anything wrong?
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Racket? What do you mean?
I know one way you can do it.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
They're not usually graduate students.
Dinner's on you.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Where's the car?
Really?
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
Anything on Korda so far?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You don't have to come here.
Satisfied?
It's all there.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
You have to. It's a tradition.
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Where did you hear that?
You think you can learn, McCall?
What's the first commandment?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
We won!
He's got the girl.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Please. I'm begging you.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
What do you think?
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
Scottie, Scottie...
Yeah.
The hell I am!
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Where's the damn wire?!
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
Any verification on numbers.
They have nothing to do with this --
God-Damn you!
It's okay.
Why --
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Who are you?!
Divinity?
You are not a God.
You were the one who was dying.
Dream?!
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
One condition.
What is it?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Not his style.
Insurance?
Then how do you know about --
What?
But you were with me.
What's so funny?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
... What's happening to him?'
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
That's pretty bad.
Release the power WITH the power.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Here you go!  No pushing!
SKULL!!
And how do we do that?
It's... an eagle?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
We're asking you to go to prison.
Boo-Boo.
Up here, Boss.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Luciano.
You could have stopped him.
So you all make the same mistakes?
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
You fellas got names?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I been thinkin'...
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Forget it. That's past.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Forget it.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Luciano is dead?
What a cozy little scene.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Special occasion?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Olive or eyeball?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
DEATH!!
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Death! Thank you!
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Holy shit.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Don't ask where I got it.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
How are you doing sweetheart?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Who is it?
What happened?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
I see.  How much?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Did you like the first act?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Drunks are funny--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Any time.
Okay. You don't mind?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
What!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Dinner, Hubert.
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
All right, why?
*You won't?*
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I did. What about it?
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Jeff for Senator.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Will the Senator yield?
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Yield *how*, sir?
It does!
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Certainly would, Joseph.
Can't you?
Whose statue is that?
Go ahead--punch.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Committee.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Letitia.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Already? All these letters?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Yay!
Where do we go from here?
A camp! Well!
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Oh--you are!
That's--that's splendid.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Joe! You *told* him to!
I know that.
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
What do you want, Senator?
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Jim!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Senator Paine will state it!
Since he was born.
They think he's pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
He's still pixilated.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Are these the articles?
Are they true!
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Now, what do you see?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Good night.
Uh-huh.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Look, I can do it!
How'd you get the picture?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
That's the rub.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
Is that the best you've got?
How is this, sir?
Relatives of old man Semple.
Nuisance value?
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
Newspaperman?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb—
Have a drink?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
We provide opera.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Naturally.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
No.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
South Dakota - north?
Is she home?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
Why are they ganging up against me?
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
You can go out there if you like...
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
What are you doing for lunch?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
I see.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
What?
No?
Where's your wife, Henry?
What is it?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
What?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
It was Henry Follett.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
...so rich?
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Hello, Lionel.
Hiya, Doc.
How are you?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What'd you want?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
What can you tell me about this?
No.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
You're doing great.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
So whose route is this?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Is it something you've heard about me?
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Hello?
Sofie...
I am irate!
Will you think about it?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
You got off easy.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
A doll?
Sounds like you have several.
At least you pulled yourself out...
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Yes... your particular approach.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
Oh yes, of course.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
The sun turning black.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
Two hundred pounds.
So who's the broad?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
I'm not?
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
It's everybody's problem!
I'm your sister.
Do you really think he'll show up?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
That looked rather painful.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
What?
I knew you'd know.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I thought you were done?
He was the last time I saw him.
How about... the Savage Six?
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Hey... you okay?
Have you considered my offer?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Come here.
What?
Yeah.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
It's me.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
So what else has Superman got?
But she still might call!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Nah.
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
You guys going to a costume party?
Wow.
Really?
So what can I get you?
It's on the television.
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Do we have to?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
I'm glad you like it.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Hello there, Picart.
My God...!  What time is it?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
When is she supposed to return?
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Ah, that is good.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
Go away -- I'm busy.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
What the hell is the matter with you?
What was there to tell?
How do you know?
You could hear them?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Is he alone?
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
I know you smoke weed, right?
Where you going?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Fuck, what's his name?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
What?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
How you know?  It could be anything.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I will.  When can I come visit?
Karla.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Most definitely.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Can I help you?
I don't play for no team.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What it smell like?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You too.
What kind of activity?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
What is it?
That the big one, huh?
Are they still out there?
I do.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
He's inside the house?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
You too big.
I can't feel my legs no more.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
What about that ugly dog?
My back.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Where to, sir?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I need your help.
How do you know that?
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Good luck.
Come with us, sir.
Yes, yes, I understand.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
What...?
Come back.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
No.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
I think you better put that away.
Ready?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
You got anything smaller?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Who?
Oh, Jesus ...
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Irene is going to help.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Fuckin' A.
Where are we going?
I'm not a baby.
That's enough.
Put her on.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
O, she's all right.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Just went?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Where's Mom?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Where are we goin', John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Where ye from?
I'll see to Pearl.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Nothin'. 
Now it's your turn.
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
John's bad.
Why, pray tell?
What's their names?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
This man down at the Drugstore...
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Okay?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Much better.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Bring him out of what?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
What!?
How you doing, pal?
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Dad -- what you doing here?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
What's the Coroner got to say?
She lived there.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Where you think you're going?
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Give me the key, mother.
Feeling better?
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
What you mean 'all at once'?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
You feel better now, right?
What is it, Ninotchka?
From Leon.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
What are you serving?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Well, a hat...
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Misha! Misha!
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
Which lawyer?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Have you?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We can wait.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Let's do that.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
Give me another double brandy.
Don't hold that against me... please!
What for... why?
At what intervals does he whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
Suppress it.
Yes, it is.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Was that talkative?
Will you smile?
Just smile.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Probably not.
I have never heard one.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
No... go on.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Comrades! Comrades!
I must talk to my brothers!
No speech.
Are we going to build our little house?
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Would that make you any happier?
What shall we get? The news!
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Is this the wish of the masses?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
That bad?  Old or young?
Thank you.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Good morning.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Where are they?
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Good morning, Comrade.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
The future of the common people.
Where to, madame?
Your Highness.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
How's the job coming, Bob?
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I understand that, sir.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
I like it.  I like the idea.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
I don't have a pistol.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Well, why not?
But what are we paying him for?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
Sir?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
More light, chief?
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What'd he say?
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Castro.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Ummm...
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Why, you got a customer?
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
... as the old alliances crumble.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
Uh, wait ...
How many?
Jesus Christ!
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
... Use his women.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
I'll do it.  No more.
Yeah ... I'm out.
You don't have to go.
This.  Above all.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Are you okay?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Yes!
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Yes.
Tomorrow.
And what am I doing?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
It'll be over soon.
What?
Some say you are, Rocky.
How many a those things you got now?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
No money in his room there?
...I don't know what I do feel like.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Carla Jean...
That's the boy.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
But you don't believe it.
What was the bullet?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Don't hurt no one.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
What's in the satchel?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewelyn --
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
Yessir?
Did you go up to his trailer?
I can't say.
Huh? What is...
...I know where you are.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
...Me?
Didn't mean nothin'.
...Will there be somethin' else?
Yessir.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
You on all night?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Good. I need everything else.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
...Keep going. Don't stop.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Waitin' for my wife.
Half.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
...What do you do?
I don't mean braze.
So was I.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Sheriff, I don't...
Jesus...
Did you send anyone out there?
Junior year!
A woman can write a check.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Great. Good. Content...
You must be joking.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
...I don't think I know that hospital.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
It's all right.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
I gotta go.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
You never gave us a chance...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
George...
Uh-huh.
What're you doing here, Roy?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
You're in serious danger!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Where you headed, Betty?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Dr. David Ravell.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
She called you 'George,' George.
You're hurting him!!
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Guess who I saw today.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Rosa, so you've met David?
What are you doing?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
The fuck you talking about?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
What do you mean?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
We can live with that.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Joyce was screwing Del.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
What?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I said 'got it?'
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Yeah?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
It ain't the law!
...Pete?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
What do we do now, Everett?
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Uh, we uh-
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
'N turned into a frog -
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Devil his due.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
...Yeah?
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Come back here, kid!
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Zack, we've got to go.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
You're good.
Before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Is your brother a flyer?
You're sure it's okay?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Lynette, where's Sid?
What did you tell him about the baby?
And you turned him down??
You got a girl?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I vote for the motel.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
Want me to get a towel?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Jets.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
No problem.
You're welcome.
You should see the look on your face.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Are you okay?
The walls are steel, right?
They're not supposed to be here!
Asshole.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
She said she did.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Yeah?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Oh, I've seen these...
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
Cut it back a little bit.
Fuck him.
He's going down.
What if they get in here?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Small space?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll do something.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I'm sorry.
What?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Alma I told you to...
What are you doing with the gun?
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
What are you crazy?
Inspector Brimmer
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Rodgers... this is no good...
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Sorry man...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Motherfuckers...
We'll all get out of here together.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Congratulations.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got salt last week.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
I know that.
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Thank you.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
How can we end this madness?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
What now, sir?
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
And your principles?
One of yours?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Goodbye, Francis.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Gray.
That bad?
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Because you promised.
Huh?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
You folks ready to go on?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
What say, Louis?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I'm not climbing that.
Almost there, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
She's finally asleep.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Getting there.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You stole my boat.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Do you believe him?
You've got sand, for a maid.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Miss Swann.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That was before I met one, of course.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Raise the sails.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Dead serious.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Move!
It's still against the law.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
No, it's not.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
He's still breathing.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
But --
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
You can't mean that.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What did you use?
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Yeah, I do!
What are you going to do?
Of course, sir.
Yes?
Susan!
When did you...?
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
That's pretty good.
What's that?
You made this out of my hair?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
Susie... I...
What in the...?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Icky!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
What in the hell?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will you step into the library?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
You have the cutest nose I've—
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Anne, come here. Listen—
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Yeah!
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Why not?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Here you are.
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What other girl—?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
A statement? Good.
Thanks. May I sit down?
I don't eat waffles.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
What is it, Smythe?
Double-strength!
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Yes - the worm!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Did you call, sir?
You try it.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Yes sir.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
What?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Have you got any make up?
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
You can't go out there.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
But where would we go?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Do you know that it's illegal?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
What do you mean!?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Noooooo!
Who's that?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
So what's it like?
You want some berries?
Can I open it?
I like calling you David.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Excuse me?
I want a word with you ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
OW!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
It's beautiful.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Free?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
...yes I'm still on hold...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
What city?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Yeah I can't.
Why's it here?
Tell me why.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hello, this is Back.
Yes.
Where are you?
No.
....no....
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I'm going to work.
Yes.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
-- you said you did.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Hello?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Do you know them.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Do you want to pick me up?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
How long have you known her?
Is everything ok?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
This is Barry.
Hi.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
It's so nice.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Where do you have to go?
Yes I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
Yeah.
No.
I don't know.
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
The police are on their way.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Who is this?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
You ok?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
What is this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
What's up?
Hey.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
I know.
I don't really remember that.
That's cool.
As soon as you want.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok. That's alright.
We should be going --
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
So...did my brother call you?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Marquis? Is that you?
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Go back to your room. Quickly.
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
His wife's?
And he's never once attempted escape?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
As for the author... shoot him.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
What have they done to you now?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
They've taken your clothes?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
...yes, I've got that bit...
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I am eternally in your debt.
Good God, Marquise --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Leave at once --
You're just scared.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Uh-huh
The actor
Oh, why is that?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Marion--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You are repellant when you drink.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
Keep filming.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
What are movies about?
Nope.
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Oh for Christ's sake-
Oh Christ...
Mank-
Let me out.
I'll hire you  -- right now-
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Craig is one syllable
Jesus Christ --
I'm sorry.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
It came.
You talked to New York?
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
For the title
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Well it' s all you've got !
For Christ's sake, shut up--
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Oh, no--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
Who's that?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Do you see her yet?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Whatcha doin'?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
Yeah. At night.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
I can't find my ball.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
You're not interested in him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
You asleep?
Huh?
Jake, no --
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
No, you're his wife.
It don't look right.
And you're drinking with them right now.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
Jeff -- huh?
If possible -- both.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jewelry?
Did you ever own a saw?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Jefferies.
This is Wednesday.
Wrong day?
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Hello.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
That's normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
Huh?
Mrs. Thorwald?
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
No.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Goodnight, you idiot.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
What do you think?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Yeah.
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
We have all -- what?
Well?
What for?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-5598.
Steady Marlon!
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
I like you, you know?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
You see any cops?
No.  We're going to bring him down.
You awake?
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
We don't have time.
Will you let him tell it!
Except yourself!
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
He depended on me.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Excuse us a minute?
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
Is he there?
John Crawford?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
He has a knife.
Are you really going to meet them?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Isn't he schizoid?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Plato?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
No.
I shot at one of them.
How!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
No.
He called me chicken.
They never do.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Okay--
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
See?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
Why did you do that?
What?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
I never felt so clean before.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Hi, Plato!
What?
Do you think your father means that?
Why?
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
A man of some travels.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Searching for a money man...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Toys for... adults?
I don't think it's negative five.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Saw me --
No, c'mon --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I told you, Nick. Remember?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Well, I don't know about that --
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Get your own room, Ashley.
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
He says he wants it now.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
No.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
No --
You... you don't know me --
So you could get down her chimney.
Where's she work?
Be more specific.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
You knew the place --
Hell. Ten?
So what the hell good are you...
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
No, you're not.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
...so where is he?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
What about the Powwow Safe?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Cancer-sucker.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
What about the money?
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Hell you haven't.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
She's using a new perfume.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Don't move, Rudy!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Tell her... I'll be there ...
NO!!!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
That was my king!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
We can work this out, can't we?
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
Who, Mr. White?
Me and Mr. White?
Didja use the commode story?
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Mr. Blue's dead?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Aren't you?
Your name's Freddy something.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Follow you where?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Nope.
I got the diamonds.
No shit?
So, is he dead or what?
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Not these guys.
This must have been in the family a long time.
You can't leave us here.
Our kind of women?
So am I.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Coffee?
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Tell me, darling.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
I won't have you fighting over me.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Why?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Half of them are mine.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
That something I shouldn't see?
You're sure there's more where this came from?
What's the matter -- restless?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You're not giving up?
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Would you like to learn them?
Gee, I can't.
What comes after Z?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
No, I won't let you do it.
Me, too. 101?
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Thanks.
Ouch!!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
He's right. I should go first.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Buddy...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Let her go, Cin.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Stop! --
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Father!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Oh.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Aww, the little bird died.
Did you do that?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Got a problem with that?
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
The image there.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
I can do it myself.
She's right. We should stick together.
You're not wearing a belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Would you like to see the girl?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
"Fucked me."
BLOOD FEAST!
0h, shit!
Hi!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
No comment!
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Detectives, what is this about?
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Objection! Argumentative!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
You bitch!
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
So you do drink?
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
Who wants fruit salad?
It's him!
That's like your car, Beverly,
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Certainly not!
Man, that one made me puke!
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
When I wanted to.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
She's a pretty good sort.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
She'll have to know some time.
No!
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
And you believe that?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Would they hurt her?
But you would like to know where she is?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I was a great dancer...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I'll be out in a minute.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Yes.
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
You are?
My therapist said that --
Aren't you?
Hi!
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
What about sex?
And they just answer them?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Tell me your name.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
About who?
About me?
On tape?
Can't.
Yes.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I can't.
Who? Elizabeth?
Don't do that.
I can't tell you like this.
I want to touch you.
Graham...
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
John?
I'm not either!!
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Goddam right.
I have thought about it, yes.
What upsets you about that?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
What brought this on?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
And what?
He just asked me questions.
Questions about sex.
What!?
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
I feel like I do.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
And that's all?
Were you disappointed?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you like the way I look?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
No.
I've got to get back to the office.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I'm intrigued.
Hello.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Why not?
No.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Plenty of room for two people.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
Hi, John.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Hi.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
You knew these people?
Well? Supper at my place?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Yes? Who is there?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
BREAKING OUT
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
We're the experts.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
You shouldn't have said that.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
Our field.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
That's an extremely negative response.
WHAT A JOKE...
THAT MINIMAL
Isn't she lovely?
The fuck was that?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
What do you think?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
I can explain.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Oh, that's tasty.
Just tell me.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
You still seeing that shrink?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
What do you smell?
That's what you do with every one.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
You should call her.
Besides what?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
With Maya.
We're on.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Do you like them?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
What's it look like to you?
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Come on, let me drive.
Look at this!
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Oh yeah? How is it?
She got anything good?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Were you ever going to say anything?
Maya.
Oh, Maya. No.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
That's great.
So what do you think?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Five. The five longest.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
I'm not going to curse.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Morgan, be careful.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Chicken Teriyaki.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was only a year and half old.
I can feel air.
It's getting stronger.
How do they know it's over?
That's good enough for me.
Don't touch him.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
What's that?
And three weeks.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Is that him?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
They got a saloon there?
It's not going to be easy.
Where you been?
Never will again.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Who is he?
Rae, all we got is each other.
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
What is it you want from me?
I'm going to have to look into this.
I thought we talked about that.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What's this?
What is it that I can't figure?
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
The public decides who's on that list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I just read somewhere --
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Where are you?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
What I do to Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Is she here?
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
You have to see her.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
She still with Kent?
How?
She thinks you're with Simone.
Why didn't she thank you?
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I know what you're up to.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
It's a hotel.
Would you like me to read?
Is Miss Simone coming today?
What if it catches on fire?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
You mean they buy it?
I am the death of real.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
What were they hiding from?
No.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
What do you want more than anything?
I told you what I want.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
--What?
You really look better.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
You were great in the play, Cole.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, you're scaring me.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Yes, Cole?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?
What--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
Good for you.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Witch.
Bitch.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Suzie???
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Come on --
Carl, what are you doing?
Gene.
Hey. Fuck you.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
You're out of your mind, man.
Are you crazy?
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
You'll be back.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
It's time to make amends.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Chicken sandwich?
Yeah. That's just the problem.
How does it feel, Keith?
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
What's wrong?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
You're... limping.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Where's Mac?
Someone better tell Mac.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
And that makes you look like a squid?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
Grant, where'd you go?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What?
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
What?
Are you nodding?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Hey there, Chief.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Meat.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Flip.
I never danced in a towel before.
I loved you. I loved --
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
You.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
You got my barley pop?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Driving, talking to me...
Well?
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
But you'll do it?
Order up!
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Or in the slammer.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Bandit?
He's history.
Shit! No one's here.
Liquid gold.
Let's get the hell outta here.
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
-- How we doing?
Talk to me.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
I think you're just yellow.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
Is your security team armed?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Who?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
D'you talk to'm?
About what?
I could have it sent out...
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
You're finished.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
What'd you say?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
I want to hear your version.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Probably.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
You want to fuck her?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
What do you remember?
You still don't believe in God?
What happened?
Why did you say those things?
You're the coward.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
Do you want to stay here?
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
Chris --
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Occasionally.
Hi.
I'm supposed to call in.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Put it on my account, please.
You all right?
I'm sorry about what happened.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Yeah.  It was.
I don't know you...
Claire...
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
So.
You still going away?
You don't have to, now.
I'll miss you, Mike.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Keep what handy?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I'd identify him.
Bought it.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Coming to bed?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you do tonight?
What did you watch?
Even Joey Venza?!
What about when she identifies him?!
At my house...!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Wasn't your fault.
Yes.
... Hard?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
How do I know that's her?
Under the table.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Can we make it a hundred?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
You should write that one down.
Some prep school thing.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
What are you doing this weekend?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
You'd feel what?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Hello, Liz.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
I'll introduce you.
I'm a photographer, remember?
What the hell is that?
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Need any more help?
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Do you... live around here?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Come on!
There's only one pair left.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
You make my mouth water.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Break it off!
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
You won't get off that cheap.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
105-353.
I'll live.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
It is.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl!
What is this? This is water?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
Let me go! Let me go!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Do Grable.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Anybody call?
Lay off, Sefton.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Who did?
You taking Dunbar?
Ach so!
The what?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Which one of us is the informer?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Have a nice time over there?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Data?
That's where he's going.
Are any of them inhabited?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Well?
I get it. I get it.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Soran?
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Well, may we have a look around?
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
Yes.  Thank you.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Aye.
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
Report.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Tractor beam, aye!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
I don't believe it...
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Hello, sir. It's David.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
What is it?
Why?
I don't understand.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
See! That shimmering area.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
But -- why?
He asked you not to grieve...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
My Lord... what are your orders?
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
So are we, it looks like.
David. Please.
Don't tell me you've got something.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
It's a long story.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I'm trying, David.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
No!
Yours... is... the superior...
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Genesis, what's that?
Thirty seconds...
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Carol Marcus --
They knew just where to hit us.
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
May I speak, sir?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
On screen...
Indeterminate life signs.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Time from my mark...
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
He's very human.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Certainly...
You lied.
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
How're you doing?
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
How long?
My name?
I do not know your name.
Go ahead. Stun me.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Can you protect us?
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Thanks.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Thanks. Cheers.
Where could you take them?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
So. There we are.
It's true... what you said...
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you going?!
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Spock...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
Status?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
10 seconds, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Any luck...?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
I am well, Admiral.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Transparent aluminum?
Father...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Why not...?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Implants bothering you?
I don't think they believe us.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Would you like something to eat?
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
You need a haircut, Commander.
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Augh.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
You think they're still up there?
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
I have helm control.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
This must be it.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
ATR setting...
Main bus...
Where in the States?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Invasion.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
What?
Were the two of you... involved?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Why?
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Target locked!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
Good luck, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Emergency override!
Report.
Wil... Data was down there.
Even Data?
Mr. President.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Spock, that was actually funny.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Damned clever if you ask me...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
He's a DOCTOR!
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Just the size of my head -
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
An accident wasn't good enough...
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
And your coat.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
I know how to get outside the shield.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
WE volunteered?
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
Captain...
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Channel open, Captain.
Gorkon's own man??
How did you - ?
If you are logical.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
A bit less florid, Data.
Yes, sir.
What do you imagine this is?
Ready, Captain.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
You have a red shirt.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Counselor.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Imzadi. This is so good.

That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
What's this?
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Strength in numbers?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Serving with you has been an honor.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
It's not quite the face you remember.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
After you, Praetor.
What are you doing?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Not so long.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
It’s too late.
The bond is broken.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Benny, God, take it easy...
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
What do you do?
What do you think of America?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I just retired.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
What?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Go.
Closed?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Who are you?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Who?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
What is hitchhike?
The driver will...
Well... I'm going to go now.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Yes.
Nobody knows.
I am not a good singer.
Are you angry at me?
Where are you going?
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
No one's traveling in this weather.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
Tell the baby about me.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I don't know where he is.
They after you?
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Can you see under the faceplate?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
Where are you going?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
We can't let you do that.
Yeah, that's right.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
You can't just... kill him.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
He has his uses too.
Maybe.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Sounds good.
What?  Right Here?
That's not sayin' much.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
You should feel like shit.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
How did you hook up with Faith?
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I always do.
Nero.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Jesus, Lenny.
Forget her.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Those two guys were cops.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
It was a tough call.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Testa?
No.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Hey, Sheriff.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Look...
What are you...?
What did he look like?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
There was talk of a file photo.
Don't you touch him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
You are so fucked up.
None taken.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
Just routine stuff.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
You okay?
All the same killer?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Agent...
Unlock these cuffs.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
If I owe, I will go.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Koessler?
I don't think you understand.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Thanks.
Yeah.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Well, thank you...?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
How?
Anything?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Me too.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Hi. Sorry about that.
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So what's the difference?
Unless she comes back first.
I'll give you an eight. 
Oh.  Where is this place?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Who threw this party, anyway?
You live in such a fantasy world...
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
We're going to Vegas.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Always, baby.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
You think so?
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Baby, you did fine.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
No!
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
She didn't like me, anyway.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
Selling scrap metal.
No. Doesn't that suck?
No.
...the Copa, in New York...
We got the digits, baby.
How long do I wait to call?
So, two days?
...against the computer.
It's on.
...shivering...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Sue...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
And you?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
But your daughter is still alive.
What do you wish me to do?
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
Eat it, it's on the table.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
You look terrif on the floor!
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
No.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
And this?
Godfather, you understand everything.
Corleone.
I know about what you mean!
Is the hospital covered?
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Will you give this to him.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're talking to themselves.
You like spaghetti?
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
A million times.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
What is it?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
And all his works?
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
Buy me out?...
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Yeah.
I think so.  Detective squad?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
You'd say if you mind?
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Shut up.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
He's drowning me!
Who's this?
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
It's just an undercoat. 
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I'm never going back!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
Shoes too?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
What are you talking about?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I've got plans!
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Frederico!
Hello?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Are you okay?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Oh my God. Tom.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie?
What?
Where does Dickie live?
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
How would you know that?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Where's Dickie's father?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Let's go.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Ditto.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Will we see you later?
My God.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He's already angry, I don't think --
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Dickie Greenleaf?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Nah, this'll be fine.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
I don't know...
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
What did you do?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
What hours do you work?
The singer?
But this is a porno movie.
Where are you going?
This is sort of high class...
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Oh, Tom, please.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
How long has he been there?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Stick up?
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
But that one night?
Well, you want to or not?
God, you are square.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
How?
I sure hate to go alone...
Have you tried the telephone?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Some. Here and there.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Anything you say, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm no cop.
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Maybe.  Not really.
Thank you.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
I believe you.
I see you got the telegram.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Do you... remember me?
I do?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
You first.
What did... what did I want to be?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Nine hundred...
When did you start smoking?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
I see...
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Here we are.
No.  But...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Wait'll you see the inside!
Yes?
I'm here.
A few.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Zackly.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
You can't testify.
Exactly.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
When'd you quit smoking?
Why not?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Is there a young Tim?
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
That's my r-r-rent.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
I suppose.  Thanks.
They all know you?
Miss Hayworth?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Would you like some brandy?
How do you like our little hamlet?
San Francisco.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then what was it?
Then why did she object to you?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Yes.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
What?
I wonder if you could help me.
Do you know him?
I see. How do I get down there?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Where would I get a boat?
Daniels.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Young woman cut herself.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Where will we go?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
We won't be here.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Then he saw.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Oh.
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
I don't know you.
Do you practice here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
We... we went to school together. College.
You like me, huh?
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
Why?
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Some cream?
Really? Tell me about it.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What it was, probably...
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Do you want to try your father again? 
Have we still got power?
You must be exhausted.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I don't know why.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Birds?
We need them.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
I'm only a student.
You must leave this house.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
He's not home.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But this woman -- and her son --
Yes, I suppose so.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
What's that you say?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
This is not a woman!
Hear him?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I would make you rich.
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
How long ago?
But can anything be done for her?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Crony indeed!
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
You killed her. I saw it.
Wrong. Answer.
Fucking Zombie.
Fuck. Me.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
No. You don't.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
You know.
How about sign of a big black bird?
What's with your friend there?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
It still doesn't mean...
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Such power exists?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Hi Mom!
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Are you an FBI man?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
How does he explain that?
You know about the United Nations?
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
It was a wonderful day.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
I will be in just a minute.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
I want to know what he told you last night.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
I don't like horror comics.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
They're gaining on us!
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
Shut up!
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Don't!  Stop!
What is this, David?
Look.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Or a vampire.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Still mad at me?
See you later.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Oh, no.  Now what?
What did you say?
Not impressed, are you?
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
He doesn't walk all over me.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Max... what are you talking about?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Then it's not too late for us...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Go away.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What's the matter?
Maybe dinner.
That night?
What was he doing in the rec room?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
How you doin', old boy?
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Let's open it.
Childs!  That a fuse?
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
We should have jumped his ass.
Spaceship of some kind.
Maybe we shouldn't.
What are you doing?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How many in their party?
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
We're on fire!
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
What if it doesn't come?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
What about Childs?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Maybe it ain't coming.
You hear that?
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
The Hall of Books.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
Yes.  Just about here.
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
When was his mother taken?
Send him away.
Vox?
Why did they built it?
Vox --
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
No, we created the Morlocks.
We make them see what we wish.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
You took her because she helped me.
Now will you go?
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
May I help you?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Talk away, Professor.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
All right, what is it now?
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
I know it's not a diamond but --
You're late.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
Alex...?!
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
We took a walk three days ago.
Heavens, look at that now!
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
You won't say that in a week.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
How long did you travel?
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Yes.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Yes, sir, he --
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
No, sir --
He said he traveled for two months.
My father has gone to a better place.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
But... what about Starks?
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Did you know my father?
What should they be looking for?
This is really happening, isn't it?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
But I like it I guess.
I think I can remember what's on them.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I looked it up.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Me, too.
What? What are you thinking?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
Where are we going?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I've been ok.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
You don't understand.
How do you know about Eugene?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Of course you don't know.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
What's this?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
I'm sorry.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Why?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Who do you think did it?
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Oh shit.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
I am the great and powerful Oz...
What?
How?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
In case of what?
Whose place is this again?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Thelma!
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Exactly.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
I'm cash poor.
What do you mean?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Call him?
Will I be?
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
That's puttin' it mildly.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
You think you've found your calling?
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Now what?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
What?!  What about him?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
He said they're charging us with murder.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is that up there?
Then let's not get caught.
Oh, Jesus!
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Mary again.
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Here's the info you asked for.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Four kids, three different guys.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Friend. Baseball bat.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
How many is that?
Ho-ly shit.
You little fuck.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Oh. Well I am.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
How do you guarantee that?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
What's he like?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Can I pour you one?
What...?
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Ted, are you okay?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hey.
You look great.
Twenty-two.
Well... why don't you move back?
Why not?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Go!
Get over here.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No! I was pissing!
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Good.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
Well, I'm not.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Oh, still sore about this.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
Secretary of Defense...
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Who are you?
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Who is he?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
I'll sleep around a little.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
What?!
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
Why does he wanna see me?
What did he say?
What's he smoke in that?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So what?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Still after Jimmy?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where was this?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
1868...
This Clear Moon's house?
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
What?
X22. Read.
X21. Come back.
Ray...
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Yeah, most likely.
I thought he'd never leave.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
You saw a MiG 21?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
What if he's not?
What about the plane?
No!
You're horrible
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Danger?
Lucky charm.
...they say you're alright.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
That's not what I hear.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
What do you do when you come here?
Want to play the game?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Well?
Well... What   is   it?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Yes, Sergeant?
Can't shake him.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
You're not supposed to...
Well, I don't know. That depends.
So I've heard.
You think you can stay up with us.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
I've lost him -- where is he?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You won?!!!
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
For the same reason you are.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
Not something they tell dependents.
You think I shouldn't fly.
What to the rebels want?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
What happened to them?
Need a ride?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
I'm listening.
Amazing.  Where are we?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Yeah.
What, aliens?
You're Kuato, right?
They sell fake memories.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
Where is he?
Shit!
I've got a lock!  There!
Would you please repeat the destination?
Is that better?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
...You mean it?
Let's do it.
And you believe him?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
I suppose you're not here either.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
I'm not interested in that.
Secret agent...How much is that?
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
This is too weird.
I think you better leave.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
What can I do?
He's lying.
Where are you going?!
You sure about this?
What's wrong?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
...Who are you?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Knock it off, Burt!
She's got my vote.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Oh my God.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
What the hell are they?
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Don't he have a home to go to?
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Use the fucking bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah...but no ties.
How's she doing?
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Down, honey, down.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Come on.  Get away from it!
And I appreciate it.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Think it's still following us?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Objection.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
You see that? You wanna be like that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Ten years is a long time.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
-- Easy as that, huh?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
That DD-5.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
...Jesus!
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
You do.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
My mother find you?
Figures.
I killed the motherfucker.
But why?
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
-- How could I help you?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Edward T. Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
No.
You getting this?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
No... No, go away.
No.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Is there a golf course around here?
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Phillip?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Sort of shorthand.
A blue rose.
I see. He does talk loud.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
You better dust this place, Sam.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Where are you going?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
How did the car get back here?
Bob.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Did you make me a tape?
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
It does matter. We're in love.
I've got to see you.
What's going on?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
No.
Josie, I think we should go public.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Can I take the car?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Who was that?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What did he find?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
What is the truth?
...he wants to testify...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
They lied.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
What book is that?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
I did.
No further questions.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Dr. Gruber...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I need an extension for my case.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
D'you find an apartment?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
What are you going to do?
Continental Casualty...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Another, Frank...?
I want to buy you a drink.
Hi, Mickey...
Uh...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
...he's a good man...
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Right.
What happened, Joey...?
How are you holding up?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
...yeah... good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Hey, how about that!
There's nobody left around here now.
Did you see it come down?
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
How does it happen cars are running?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
How long was I out?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That needle ain't pointing north!
What is that gizmo?!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What'll we say to 'em?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
One of mom's cups got broken.
No, you don't.
What if it isn't over?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Guess so.
What's up?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
These look quite fresh.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Someone's coming.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Time for sleep.
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
In what, a romantic comedy?
When do you think it'll be done?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
I've never mentioned it to him.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
That was Nancy, not me!
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
No, not really.  I...
Looks like weather.
You sound so sure.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Where's Mom?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Yeah.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
He does.
But that's not the point...
Passport?
Good.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Stow away?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Who is it Philip?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Immortality.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
Don't ever call me stupid.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
How would you know?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
What?
Well, that was neighborly.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
It's outta here!
No, sir.
Swing up, son.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Need a hand?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What is it?
Nice of you to drop by.
You heard from Reggie?
Gas?
Club Zanzibar.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
You hitched yet?
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
So, it's back to the islands.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
What happened on the charges?
The Good Witch...
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
In what capacity?
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
You won't of missed much.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
What brand'd she smoke?
In a fire, as I recall.
Sailor?
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Actin' funny how?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
...are followin' him around.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
That don't smell like a More.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
What was this one?
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You're scarin' me, baby.
There's worse places, honey.
And no AC.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Sail?
You must be my son.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
How can you say that, Sailor?
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Mama???
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Have it your way... But you want it.
You need to explain it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Where? In the leg?
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
I know... I remember.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Tripp!
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
He said something about being between things.
Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He has a book.
He is. Take my word for it.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Which is?
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
So -- what do we do now?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Naturally you have copies.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
You peeked, didn't you?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Is that in my chart?
She told you about...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
No. There's no one here.
Vernon.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
...reconcile with Emily.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Well...
They're glass. The buttons.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Yes.
Afraid so.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Who?
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Colon cancer.
Carvel.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Maybe she didn't come here.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
But, last night...
I'm not going with them.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, Hannah?
Me? Sure. Why?
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
But where? I need the street.
New?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
He told you.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Does he still love you?
The more the merrier.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
Who's that guy?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
You doing okay?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Annette? She's good... tense.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
C'mon, Walter.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
There's a million birds here.
You always carry these?
I'd love to hear it.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Were you watching me?
I have to go.
See anything interesting?
What are you writing in that book?
Don't you have friends?
What does that mean?
I think you do.
I haven't broken any laws.
Doesn't everybody?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Okay?
Too much sun.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
You walked home.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You knew her?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I'd say you're moving.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Just trying to be helpful.
Have you seen Walter?
Yeah, like the bird.
No thank you.
What's her name?
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
That's right.
How's the journal?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
How long is this going to take?
I want to be normal!
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Please don't do it again.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Who do you see?
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
I'm talking about you.
You're quiet at work.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What about bears?
Hey, that was... intense.
What's the problem?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Did I say something wrong?
Why do you want to know?
Sorry.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
I'm sorry, Walter.
You know, this is crazy.
Are you serious?
We should live together.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
She-hit.
You got it?!  You got it?
Where are we?
You never did like being called that, did you?
I think you were worried about me.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Need some help?
I think it likes you.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Uh, oh...
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
What kind of light?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
How wonderful!
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Don't be so humble.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Then why do you say them?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
I'm too sleepy.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Have you ever been in love?
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Anything new develop?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
But where did you come from?
Whose boat is that?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
And how come you're up so early?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Why have we stopped?
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
No.
Because...
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
I'm not hungry.
I'm being punished.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Who?
Often?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
From God.
Don't you know?
Why not?
Why should I?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
Agnes...
Do you?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
And you're unhappy.
Agnes...
What did you do?
She's dead isn't she?
She tells you you're ugly?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Who am I?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
I'm frightened.
Did you know what was going to come out?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Hm hmm.
What is it?
Who?
A wastepaper basket.
No.
Why isn't anyone coming?
Who?
Him.
It was dead.
You saw it all didn't you?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Look into the convent records.
Martha, it's you.
I'll have it.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Marie's dead Mama.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
You were a smoker?
Is that normal?
How did she hide it during the day?
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
The Catholic Church...
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Mary Magdelen?
May I be present?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Don't be ridiculous.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Somebody told her.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
The baby?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Before or after you killed the child?
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
The usual ten per cent?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
What are we waiting for?
Sorry.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Are you pulling my leg?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And what do you do about it?
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
And what's it all come to in the end?
Where are you off to?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
And we're looking after him, are we?
Come on let's get this coffee.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
I hope he fell off.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Behave...
What's he know?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
What's old got to do with it?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
I'll brook no denial!
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You are.
Is it?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Where's my grandfather?
He belongs to Paul.
None for me, then?
That's mine.
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
What is he?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
I feel like shit...
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Close enough to walk to!
What is it?
How do you feel, Dell?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
A transmission?
Yes!
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Where does that go?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
Hey, guess what?
Yes?
Can you get them back?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Blow the ship up?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
This should do it.
What'd he say?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
I thought I'd find you here.
They're on the next level up.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
Let's hear it.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Find anything we missed?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Take us up.
Engaged.
Now what?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No... don't...
What is it?
Better?
It's a rhino.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Something spooking the rhinos?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Forget it, man.
Wait.  Lost it.
Is it still moving?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
That's what we thought.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
That's the wrong way!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Jesus.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
Hungry?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Just like that, eh?
Just like it.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
What time?
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
I can't believe my ears...
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Bill!
Good luck, genius...
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
I told her. I sounded off.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Need any help?
When I'm guest of honor?
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
What fire and music?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Well, I am.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Yes, dear.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Find out.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Why not?
She's loyal and efficient-
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Oh, but there is-
Eve... don't cry.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Addison wants me to play it.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
No, don't go...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Right here.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
It's the tight girdle that does it.
She's just outside the door.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
How far to the station?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Lloyd, what happened...?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Well of all-
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Who's left out there?
How's the new one coming?
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Yes, sir.
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--it was fine the way it was--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
See her?  Get anything?
Anything you've got.
I hate both parties.
Goddamnit--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
Nah.  Maybe.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
Woodward?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
You've really got to go.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
Something maybe big.
Who by?
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
What's this?
--I saw him. He verifies.
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
Yes, sir.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
How grand?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Where in government?
Where?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
...go on, go on...
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Who's Charles Colson?
--who you got?--
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
--which Young?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
All right, I got some scotch.
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Just go!
Not bad, Chris.
What's your middle name?
What?  No I'm not.
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
Stifler told me.
You want onions?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
This isn't any better, Chris.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
No you haven't.
No comment.
There's our man.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Hey, where's Finch?
That's stupid.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
You're not...busy?
Yes.
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
What was your name again?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
...excuse me?!
This'll do.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
I still think you're okay.
Tonight?
Vicky, wait.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Yeah Vick?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
What reputation?
Kevin, it was just a --
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Really?
The key is don't look down.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
We don't both have to die.
Didn't even have to ask.
Whoa...
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Oh God. Shit...
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
Pull over! Now!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
Because Gaston was after it.
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Why would he pick this one?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Noooo....
Forged papers! Now, what?!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Oh! I'm sorry...
No! Well, yes, but
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Don't you, child?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
So where will you go?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
What do you want?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
She does.
I had nothing to do with it!
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Yes.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Stop it, Alvy!
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Well, then, w-who was?
Hi. Hi, hi.
Right!  Where?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Huh?
Your grammy!
Oh, I see, I see.
God bless.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
And we'll digest our food better.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Look at these guys.
No, I'm not.
You- Do you love me?
Don't you think I do?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, you have my body.
Were you always funny?
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
and I keep, you know, it's-
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oooh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Two?
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
That's sick!
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
What?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Yes.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Sixteen years ago.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Stop calling me Max.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
There are no twos, Max.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
But she's colored.
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Well, hi!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Did you know the contractor?
Was it a contractor?
So who won?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
It's going.  It's going.
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
I'm not.
Oh.
Oh.
Well, probably.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I never put myself in harm's way.
Can I open it?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
And?
Cal, my wife Judy.
Go.
It was fifteen seconds.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
We'll be fine.
No luck.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Kiss the back of my knees.
What?
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
Don't get it.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
In the kitchen.
Dolphins.  Great.
She left the fucking gate open.
Fuck you.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
And how hard it hit?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Anyone else?
Don't.
I don't want to go tonight.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
I know.
Has she called?
Yes, she is.
Yes.
Not long.
The infamous dog?
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
Please, Ryan.
Something soft.
Sally did all this herself?
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
I need to leave you now.
What am I, five?
Medallions.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Of course it's alright.
Jesus Christ.
Ready to go?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
I...
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Well, something's wrong.
You're my best friend.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Enough about me.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Are you asking me out to dinner?
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
You dance...
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
And only you can become a Queen?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Bala!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Barbatus!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
...I should?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
This the place?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Oh, I never catch colds.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Good night.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
I forgive you.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
His apartment?
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
I would.
Are you all right?
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
I guess so.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Baxter?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
I'm not through with you yet.
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
This?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Oh, yes. Thanks.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Sir?
You left your wife?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Yes, sir.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Good evening, Baxter.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
What are you going to do, Doc?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Any of that coffee left?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
What for?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's been hell.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
You're out of your skull --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby what?
Rangers, eh?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
A sauciere --
And the grass?
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Get in there !
They're not Cong.
Listen.
Anybody see some smoke ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Who is he?
No, sir.
Good swell.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Did you know him very well?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Were you with him, when...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
What's that?
He'll kill us.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You hear it again?
You think?
The other one --
What?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
This boat's a mess.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
30   CONTINUED:
34   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
215  CONTINUED:
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
184  CONTINUED:
What happened here?
He's coming around fine.
Did you catch Corbett?
Was there any trouble?
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
Where's Corbett?
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Leave it here.
Ben Corbett?
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Be my guest.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Don't push me..!
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
What's wrong?
Neff, you know better than this...
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Do you love me?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
So you'll be at work?
Getting loud, getting loud.
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
The stiff one eye?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Thanks, Melvin.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Was this supposed to be your room?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Shall I get her for you?
No. Please, don't force him.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Absolutely.
Oh, is he dead?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Go away.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Because...  ... you love her?
But you know where you're lucky?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Why are you doing this?
What?
Yeah.
Okay.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
I'm on the scent.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Is this how it went, Nick?
You think this is a fucking joke?
What?
Um, five.
Bullshit.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
You want me to pump?
Why?
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
He was... taken.
More or less.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Why?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
That's where he'll be.
Two way?
I paid a lot for these.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
You didn't take it.
I think I got one today.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
That's a ridiculous move.
Because, I'll take it.
Yes.
What happened to her?
Did you --
Is this becoming complicated?
Were you attracted to me right away?
When did it start?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Would you like a drink?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Is that all you want?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
How would you like the funds?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Cheers Katka!
How to make a buck!
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Need any disks?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Like a hand?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Don't tell me you really are in love?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Now you're using that word.
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
I made a deal with Josh.
Take this exit.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
They'll do it.
Okay?
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Where did you steal the car?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Really!
Would you like your things now?
It's more than what you're worth.
Shall I look after the rest?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
What are you an idiot!
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She asleep?
'Bout what?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
A late night or an early morning?
Were you with Jamie?
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I told him to leave me alone.
Now it's okay?
Hypotheticals --
The address?!
Deranged.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You don't know me.
'Is it really me?'
I'll take a chance.
So what else is on this list?
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Like you'd know.
No problem --
I'll get something for us to drink --
I know. Don't say anything.
Saturn. Beautiful.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
You're really into God, right?
Yeah.
You have to believe to have faith.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
People can see.
Your turn.
Before we do this.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
You make me feel...
Assholes. This happen to you?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Are you trying to seduce me?
From citizen high to citizen low.
What are you going to -- ?
Nope.
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
By accident --
What's Landon Carter up to?
Did you give him a gift?
I care for her.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Hi, Marty.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Fine..
No, Chinese food is fine.
What do I say?
Huh?
Why what?
Your line, George!
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
A gold mine?
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
Pardon me?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
My guess is that she turned him down.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
That's all taken care of.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
I'll catch up with you.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Well, Kit...
Okay.
That's my father. I got to run.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Why not?
What a nice place.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Is that all there is to it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I can look and see.
Look at all this junk.
What'd you put him in there for?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Don't.
Yes.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
What's that?
Hi.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
You're my friend, aren't you?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
You didn't walk out here.
Hi.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
Apache?
Anybody we know?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
He offered you money?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Oh, my.
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What's his problem?
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
...This'll sometimes help.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
Well that's what he said.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...That's fine.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Howdy, neighbor.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
It's okay, it's okay.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
You're leaving?
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Are you sure –
Barton. Are you all right?
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
It's okay... It's okay...
You'll be back?
...Where did we put him?
...Yes, thank you.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Fink.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Is this multiple choice?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
How is your -- personal life?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
We were in some of the same classes.
I need a cigarette.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Who?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Why did you change your name?
You should do something about this lock.
Did you go home with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you have a cigarette?
I told you -- I quit.
What's your new book about?
Am I... disturbing you?
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Aren't you going to thank me?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
How'd you get in here?
No.
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
I finished my book.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Did you ever tie him up?
How did he die?
It teaches you to lie.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What kind of drugs?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
I never heard of him.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Was she ever suspect?
What's goin' down, son?
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not afraid of her.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Maybe the maid did it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
So what do we do -- nothing?
Why do you think he's dead?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Is this finished yet?
When's your show?
Naa..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Ten bucks apiece.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Ouch..
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Jean, your parents are here.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Not what?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Paint it out.
You want me to put it here?
Who am I?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
You're shattering all my myths.
We got beat.
... What's the matter?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
... babies.
What's that?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
I really... admire you.
Would you check out my studio some time?
Some of them.
See you later.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
That one's for you.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother – when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
You don't have any!!!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
No.  No glass on the inside.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Y'mean frame him?
Ten, nine...
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I don't.  So, no.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
I was just hanging around.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
How did you...?
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
What happened to his wife?
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Like hell you do.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
No gun.  How disarming.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Make yourself right at home.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
What say we turn up the heat?
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
It'll never work.
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
There's one other thing. I feel..
All the answers are numbers.
What do maniacs always want?
And another name for Mystery?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Why's that?
You are direct, aren't you?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Like normal folks.
Fast work. You just moved here.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Back off, man.
You can't-.
Chase?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Go ahead. You can say it.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Do you want a drink?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
And what happens if we say no?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
... Why the mask?
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Ali?  What's wrong?
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Oh yes.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Say that again, son.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
This sucks.
What a dork. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
So, like, where is she?
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
That's not that much.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Turd-burglar...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Talk ta me, Bork.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Cool, huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Really? That's where we're from.
You scored with two chicks?!
She's ready.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
You'd better sit down, hon.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
What?
I don't think we survived the crash.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
That little girl saw us.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
What about this Beetle guy?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
And your sushi was remarkable.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
What...?
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Are you available?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just one daughter.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
The attic room is locked --
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
What's wrong?
What do you think?
You don't have a key?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Otho, that's terrible.
Their wedding clothes.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
I would like to walk today.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... He walked off...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
A Black man gave me the message.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Would you care for a drink?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, I like that very much.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
Yes.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Can you see well?
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Bravo!
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Certainly, Ben.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
... Sir?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Some pictures...?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
Please, sir.
... My suitcase.
How long do we stay in here?
... I see.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Since you were a child?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Good morning, Mr. President.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
Yes. It has.
Yes. I will.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
And look who you brought with!
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
I can certainly understand that...
This is not what I requested.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
... So what does all that add up to?
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I never played a jewel thief.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
The iguana.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
What are you doing?
What about Maxine?
You were him last night, weren't you?
And he was with her.
We?
Don't forget me.
Suck my dick!
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You fell in love with her first.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
My God!
Pardon?
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Security.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yeah.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Hi.
This is important!
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
I've fallen in love.
You're glowing again.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No.
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
The Great Mantini?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Forget it.
Says me. Do you dream often?
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Anybody else?
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
What's the play?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You still know.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
You don't sit with me!!
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
I want somethin' sweet.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
She gone like they say?
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
But mama..
Mama let me help you.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Leave off..
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Hey!!
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Hiya Allan.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
I know my rights.
Uh-huh.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
What's this?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What do you mean, Dude?
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
I was bowling--
He peed on the Dude's rug--
It's already posted.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
No, they--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Ahh, not so good, man.
I like your style, Dude.
Which one was Logjammin'?
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
A hundred.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Increases?
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Hey man--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
The fucking point is--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Wooden bridge, huh?
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Yeah.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
It is a fucking emergency.
Shit yeah!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
It's a heart attack.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Dude here.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Employed?
Is this a--what day is this?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Smokey Huh?
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Walter--
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Where to first?
What was that?
Recognize him?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
It means "bloodbrother."
You came back for me.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
Put it back in park, Blade.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
But he's a policeman --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Just get out of here.
You care about him, don't you?
Any progress?
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
Get out of here --
No --
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
What happens then?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
But you use blood banks --
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
How did you escape?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
What happened to the power?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What happened to her, where did she go?
No.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Domini?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
What's she look like?
--how old?
--the witch kills children--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Anna--
You want me to scooch over next to you?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Nothing. I dunno--
Just...try and go back to sleep.
--like you hurt the baby--
Oh, Jesus, no--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can't you like just divine it?
Never would've guessed.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
We should be so lucky.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Mi casa y su casa!
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
What the fuck--??
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Just hold on!
Oooh. Oooh.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
For a blur?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
Jesus.
What?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
What?
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
"It's why the witch kills children."
What the fuck's going on here?
Why?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...Well I'll be damned.
...What?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...That's what's important.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
He needs a room, Dusty.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
What night is it?
I told you. I like you.
What's the matter?
What "what"?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
What's this?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Thanks Meurice.
...Why?
Where was I?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Come into the study a minute.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Not yet.
Hello, baby.
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
Can I feel 'em?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Bull.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Do you like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Don?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Who is Don?
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Yes.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
I don't want to go.
Heineken.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
So. what's next?
Yes. I do.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
What was that all about?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. no. Why?
... Sandy?.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
What?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Tuna, this is crap.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Why are you speaking?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
What can I do for you guys?
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
And I only deal with you?
You?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Oh my G-d.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
What type of planes do you have?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Diego Delgado, please?
Diego?  It's George.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Cocaine?  How much?
G-d, son.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Layaway shmayaway.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Sure.
Keep them coming.
George, you look terrible.
Diego?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Just low.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Hi.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
You're not going to trial?
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
I meant every word of it.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Where are you going?
No, that's alright.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
What do you want from me?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
For instance, something like this?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Yeah?
No shit, Kevin?
Smith.  Hampshire....
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Can you read?
It's good nobody is following us ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
To show them to the UN, right?
Where were we?
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
How you doin' Mister D?
I've been waiting for you to get back.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Take some time off.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
So she knew about his heart?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Yeah.
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Why would she want that?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Who found him?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you ever see her again after that?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What did you prescribe for her?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
High school?
I heard him say it.
No.
What happened next?
What about Miss Lawson?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
--and that he changed his will?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Hi, Joe.
Are you going to represent me?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Why not?
This is your house.
Why not?
Hi, Frank.
Sorry.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
Why would she lie?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
I'm dropping the case.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
I can back it up.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Yes.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
It's a beautiful picture of her.
How bizarre!
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Yeah.
What?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
She's changed.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Roseman Bridge?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
And how long are you here for?
Is the dizziness gone?
Help cook?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
And did you?
Why did you stop?
You drink bug repellent?
So what happened?
You really don't need anyone?
But no one in particular.
No, I'm just saying --
I would love to come for dinner.
Okay. See you later.
It's Robert.
How about if I set the table?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why do you say that?
I can't do this, honey.
Where was she?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
What are you doing?
How do you know what I experience?
What do you want me to say?
STOP IT!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Where you going?
Betty.
Is it true?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
You think that's really him?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
That's what?
You got a nice crib here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Where are we, baby?
But.
Sorry, my brother.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
The dead get out?
Cinn?
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Where is it?
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
Please...help me...
What the hell do you want?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Open the case!
Caesar?  What is this?
We're family, Caesar.
They were early.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't see you, did he?
Shut up, Violet.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
You know he would have done you, too.
Where is it?
You can't kill me yet.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Is that the money?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
This is a beautiful place.
Who?
'63 Chevy.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Okay, one drink.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
No.
...  I needed that.
Five years is a long time.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What are you afraid of?
Because it's the truth.
You said he washed the money?
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
What did Gino drink?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
What if he sees you?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Oh, God.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Are you Treadstone?
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Who do you think sent me?
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
His brother.  You know his brother?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We thought you were gone for good.
Was it the break-in?
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride.
I need a ride out of here.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
-- you could put it together --
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I needed a break.
We're about an hour away.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Yes.
You have ID?
Where did this body go?
Tell him we're busy.
-- what're you talking about? --
... fix themselves.
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thanks very much Sam.
Sorry ...
Help me!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Christ! You do know it all!
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
Take her off the list.
Trust me.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
How could you do this to me?
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Stamped?
Are you alright?
Who are you? Let go!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Why?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
OK. What's in the parcel?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Look at that - right on time.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
That's it.
Can I forget it?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Sam!!! 
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Hello ... hello ...
What the - ? How did you - ?
What is it?
Ha!!
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Can you fix it?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
No, no, that's impossible.
Where is she?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
IB Bangin.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Yes?
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
I think I'd remember that.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He one of them?
What do you think?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Last show of the night.
I'm sorry.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Whatja doing?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Do it!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
He's crazy.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Yes.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Nine seconds.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Yes.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Do you feel good about it?
Don't go.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
I think you're the Devil.
How?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
Just a few questions?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Jane?
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Play back the last line...
Because...
They're not really going to call security are they?
How do I get out of here?
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
What?
Yes.  How do you know?
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Bye, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
One year...almost one year.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
I'll wait for you till seven.
I didn't think you'd make it.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
No.  Did he really?
Then give me a minute...
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Where's the bathroom?
Are you okay?
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
It was.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Maybe so...
Murdered...man?...
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
I wonder what his deal is.
Walter, what are you doing?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
You might talk too much.
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
Hello, Walter.
Police officer.
I- don't know what you're talking about!
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
What's wrong with you!?!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Well, um... litter?
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Yes.
Wheels?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Hi, Buffy.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
What's Bobby gonna say?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Where are you gonna go?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Hey, Buffy...
Thanks.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Everybody does.
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
None of your business.  God.
Wait a minute.
What, um...  What do we do?
Uh... gym.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh.  Sorry.
Put your head back.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Same one.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five?
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Interesting.
No THX.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
The mark of the Coven.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Write that down.
Buffy?
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Omniplex?
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
What are you talking about?
And the January Semi-formal --
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
I'm yours.
No.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
We lost.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
You should be at the game.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Damn.
Damn.
He' s confused--
And now you wanta teach me?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
It's possible.
Why not?
What happened?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
You a God damn witch?
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I didn't spit on you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Fastball.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
Can I ask you something?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Nuke--  Good luck.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Take the first shot at me.
I gotta go now, Dad.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
No.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
What'you want, kid?
Ain't here.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Look at yours.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
A powerful man.
...stupid things.
...been right, but who knows?
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
She's not here, Sam.
I'll call you right back.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Okay, Sammy.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
No, of course not.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
You should say so.
All right, fine.
All right.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Okay?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Yeah.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Well, sir, I was just...
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Sam, we got a problem.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Okay, thank you for asking.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Why're you crying?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Right?
You sure?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Huh?
Hello.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
How serious?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Get off of me! Stop it!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
You threw it away?
Oscar wants you to call him.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Hi, Sam.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Now you need approval from him to go home?
Just wait there for me!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
...worst possible time for me.
No.
Excuse me.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
When I left here with the money...
You know where she gets this from!
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Carmine left?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Fine.
Hi, Jennifer.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Sure.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thank you.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Yes, you did.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
I'm here.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Right.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Yeah.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
You must have drunk too much.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
There's a lot of people here.
Take it easy, though.
The crowd bought it.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...

He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Women, huh?
I better go report this in...
I've been looking for you.
God, can you hear me!
What do you want from me?
Pass!
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
For when the time comes..
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Yeah, she's okay.
How much?
Next time, call...
Did you try to kill...
You're late.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Any place.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Who's on the phone?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
You gotta just look the other way.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
Let's have your license, mister.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Any minute.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Lady, try making some sense.
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Our house always needs touching up.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Do you know what's in that box?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
It won't be him.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
He wants 75 back.
What's Nels' number?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
What's happening?
Any idea where you're going?
They did some great job of reforming you.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Naturally.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
They saw you kill the driver.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
We're waiting on you.
You should've done all this before.
Negative.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Stop the crying.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who am I talking to?
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Who's this?
What does it take to kill you?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
I can see the benefit in that.
We're gonna get there first.
Where's the backpack?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
He gave me a look.
Good thing in a man.
Fuck off, Dave.
Jimmy.
Fuck off back to Essex!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
And what's it like?
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
Hi.
You all right?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Would you like a drink?
No.
Do I?
Why?
Tell him it hurt --
Sorry, darling.
You could?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
So I'm sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Should have stayed a girl.
So I got it wrong, then.
You'd do anything for me?
Don't call me that --
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I had to go to work!
Come on...
Your soldier.
Died...
You killed my Jody
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
You like me now, Jimmy?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Say it again.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Fergus!
See does he want some.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Eddie and Tinker died.
So you did fuck up.
And what if I say no?
You a handyman, Fergie?
So he knows your name?
Yes.
Why?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
He's at home.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
What makes you think that?
No, what's the funny thing?
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck am I doing here.
Oh, yeah.
Do you?
See if she's all right.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Go to sleep now.
Like the one about the frog?
Not here.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
Oh!
What?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Yes, you told me.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I said, tell me to go to the --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Only we call them agents.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Oh.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Café.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Back where?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Why you lied to me.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
You can't.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
Why can't you be serious?
Who told you to do that?
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Yes, I know.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Of course it is.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
But he is gone.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Peter Joshua.
Please, not on my account.
I'm not sure I --
Is your husband with you?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Are you in the book?
How did you find out?
Come on. You can't stay here.
I wasn't --
On the street where you live.
Nothing. Good night.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Go on.
So they think he left it with you.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Who is it from?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Yeah? What's that?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Yeah?
I think it's funny.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
It's almost ten o'clock.
Hi honey.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
You found her?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
We just found another body.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
_ Your father raped someone?
Go sit next to him.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Hide your laptop here.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
 Oh, shit.
A little early for a delivery.
Where do you want this stuff?
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
He could've called first.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
All right, then how about this?
Go on.
That dog ain't mean.
It happens to this piece of shit...
You stole this truck! That's...
...-damn!
Ah, one of them's in the back.

Oh, shit.
Okay!  All right!
    Elvis is on ice again.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
Fuck! 
...Shift.
I think...


Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...wanna give it a try!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
...ho!

 Go on.
No.  Shit.

All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
You're--?  What?!
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Keep still.

...did you?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
It won't even start half the time.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.



Come here.
Go!
Hang...
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Oh, fuck!
Here...
Okay...
Stupid.
Mason.
What?
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
What'd you come back for?!
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Us.  Owes us.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Vaughn.

Yeah, that's my truck.
...take my sorry old truck.
You got a prob-...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!

Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
Now listen to me.

...about--
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--

Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.

This was supposed to be a...
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Dennis!
I wanna patch in from...
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Is this your establishment?
Assumptions are always...
Doc...
Yeah?
Video lock.
It's after five...
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Great.  All right...
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...

Mason.
The compound has to be kept cold...
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
...you, Mason?
Where are you now...
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
 Listen, Pappas...
Don't move!
  All right.
Yeah, I'm sure.

Gimme this god-...
 Talk to me.
Arlo.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
Sir?
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Very.
What for?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Just find the girl.
What does this mean?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Haven't the faintest idea.
How much are you worth?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
They don't kill a guy for that.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
That's a filthy habit.
How do they do that?
Congratulations.
I'd like to talk to him.
How do you happen to know her?
I want the rest of the pictures.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Where?
What's the maid's address?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
You left your keys in the ignition.
I got your check in the mall.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, yeah?
You sure shout that?
Know him?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
When was the last time?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Hold still. Why?
...No. Why was it.
What's wrong?
Where?
I know.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you get some sleep?
Upstairs. Why?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Walsh here?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Yeah, Sophie.
Oh my goodness.
There's just one question.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Never?
When it comes.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
So he says you sent them?
Not exactly.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
That's for sure.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
What are you doing here?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Will they really find work in Germany?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Yes. I want proof.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
So what'd they say?
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
You're still beautiful...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Three cents.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Oh yes, there is.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Ow!
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
Oh!
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Is that what you want to do?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
At night?
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Yes?
What do you mean by that?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I'm drunk.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Maybe you could remember something that -
I know, but -
That's the whole works, right up to date.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Hey, now wait a sec...
That's it, everybody out.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Why aren't there any lights?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
I was here the whole time.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
I just told you.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You're serious. You want to date again.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Sang.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
I'm serious.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
This is the last time I come to this place.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
Excuse me, do you have...
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Shit!
You're late.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
That's what I said.
What smells like shoe polish?
She called me.
Five years.
Eight and a half.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I think it's safe to say yes.
All four?
What's that?
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
She's in here?
The quest isn't going well?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What did he say?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
There aren't.
The milkmaids.
Thirty-seven!
Vermont?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Julie Dwyer died.
Oh, my god.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
No!
Who found him?
He made it, hunhh?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
I want to rent a movie.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
What the fuck did you do that for?
What?
No way!
Then how come you got the fine?
Hey, what about Veronica?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Do you work tomorrow?
To say the least.
Are you open?
Just the paper.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
You know him?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Go open the video store.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Why did you agree to come in then?
What? What is that?
"Be there?"
And I actually date you?
How many girls have you slept with?
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
What do you mean?
He requested this?
You sucked that guy's dick?
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many?
HOW MANY?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
You had to tell him.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
A couple...?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
He only speaks Russian?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I do about three-fifty, four.
Feel that.
To an Asian design major.
Really?
You hope what feels good?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Twenty bucks?
Willam!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
I will. Take it easy.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
I'm coming out!
She's losing it!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
What are we going to do?
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Can I count as fast as I like?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Hello, Gabriel.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
What if he can't?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Let's be creative.
It was great.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Gabe...your arm?
Nice view, huh?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
We might be able to go that way.
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Reach up!  Do it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Wrap it around that rock twice.
What about you?!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
He'll freeze.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
He never hurt anybody.
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Where's the third one, Travers?
I don't trust him.
This way.
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
You got what we need?
Rich...
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
So this is the young man?
Thank you very much, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
What job and how much?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Fine, fine.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I wanna be sick.
Brown hair, is it?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Fine... fine.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
You're keen on music?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Carry on, Chief.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You like being a lawyer?
But not now?
Max, the cab driver!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
A deer?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
It's nothing.
Quite an achievement...
You're gonna cheer up.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
I'm standing right here.
He's not paying you one cent!
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?
You prefer nights?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
We have a deal.  What's your name?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
What?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Get rid of 'em.
Please.  Don't do anything.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Collateral damage.
Vincent?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
Jazz.  Music.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Let him go, Vincent.
Max?  What are you doing?
Limos, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Gimme your wallet.
How long have you been a hit man?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Yeah, that.
It's what I do for a living.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
There you go...!
And you believe me...?
You're going too fast.
Slow the hell down!
Max?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I never told her.
I was only going one way.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
I don't see the connection.
Not for years.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Who are you, Jerry?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
You look great.
Now what?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I believe you.
Without a song in my heart.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
Thank you.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
You made your decision yet?
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Where'd you get it?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Yes.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
I want to believe you, too.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
I disagree.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
What is it?  What's happened?
You...
You aren't staying?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
What?
And?
How can that be?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Dr. Cullers?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Talk to him.
You're not real.  None of this is.
Am I one... or many?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
You live here.
Some kind of circuitry...?
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Ellie -- are you okay?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
'My father's house has many mansions.'
I flinched.
Do you love your parents?
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
So.  The final countdown.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Oh my God...
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Comin' out here, Boss?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
You can't do that!
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
But there's still daylight left.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Whatta you so happy about?
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
But, Luke...
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Back a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
What?  What'd I do?
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
I never hurt nobody...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
How do you know that?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
We've got another one.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
You're afraid of him.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Are you always so bold?
It's a woman shot in a car?
Just get out of your vehicle...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
I was.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
I heard. Good police work.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Answer it.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
Detective Niccoletti?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Not a lot of action here.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
What!? They brought the car here?
It's about time.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Have you seen his penis?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
Please finish your story.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
What is it?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
How?
Maybe.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
What do you think of this one?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
Which flowers did you order?
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I'm really not that hungry.
It had this red spot on its back.
What are you looking to read?
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
He asked me to marry him.
Really, this isn't funny.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I wish I could have seen that.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
I have a terrible confession.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Well?
Tell me all.
Furnished?
I love the pillows.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
This must be Beast.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I sure know what that feels like.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
You don't have a fever.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
What are you doing?
Sure. Why?
Are you all right?
Especially now.
So will you?
You what?
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
All tapped out.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Where are the tapes?
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
They left about a half hour ago.
Hello?
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
And?
They're gonna be what?
Someone else coming?
Uh, no --
I don't know.
Because you're the closest.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Bring me the scissors.
That moron.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
We still have to get out of here.
Hello?
What?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Guns.   Can you get them?
I'm from Belgium.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
I just thought that--
And the other car?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What about transportation?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
How about Canada?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
-- I want to be Elvis.
No.   It's mine.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How are we going to do that?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I think we went the wrong way.
You're not helping.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
I can't even hear myself think.
And how do we do that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Did she break your heart?
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
Who are you waiting for?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Where's your master?
You're already a thief.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Please.
No, really?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
What do you want?
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
It's Jade Fox!
What in the hell... do you call that?
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Don't interfere.
Mom --?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Neither.
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
That thing is poisonous.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Thank you.
You promise not to say anything?
So what year are you going into?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
You need help.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
About what?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
You're naked.
And that's a bad thing?
I'm... I'm alright.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Good for you.
Please don't go.
Hi.
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
The football stud?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Those are my letters!
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
That's great.
Are you for real?
What are you saying?
Well do you like him?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
He made you give him a blow job.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
I look terrible.
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
But -
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Don't you want to change that?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Yes.
Is she with you?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!
One.
Hello.
Yeah?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
What are the terms?
You can put it anywhere.
What's wrong with you?
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Moving along quite well.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Tell me all the details.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Ronald?
To my triumph, of course.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
You're too kind.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Ronald? That's crazy.
She's not here.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
I'll do that.
Right after we played backgammon.
Hey Ronald.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
What are saying, darling?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I know that.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Something's haywire,
Did you hear the child out?
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
But I told her to go with you.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Now Amy
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
What'd you get for Christmas?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
I've wanted a friend.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Can't you get it, darling?
Oh, how beautiful!
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You?
Look at my ring.
A lady threw it to me.
I wasn't singing to myself.
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Mommy read it to ne.
The Headless Horseman --
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Let the child stay.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Translation: a total geek.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
He hasn't said one word to me.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Hey, did you get contacts?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
And then?
At least your PMS is over.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Are those Mark's?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
DON'T call the police.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Why the fuck would you do that?
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I think George knows.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I know.
I'm really tired.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
Coffee and...
It's stupid.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Like what?
No, why?
Except Mark of course.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
What's with the squirt guns?
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
Here's a towel.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
It's for you. Frida.
How the hell is that your business?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
How can I submit this?
Where are we going?
People...  after me.
They didn't have faces.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Water?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
Horrible...
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I'm sorry.  About before.
Why?
It's a trick.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Choices???
Nightmare...
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Clean.
What about the wife?
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
You're kidding.
Three years.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What's with the cameras?
What I told him to?
I don't think so
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Presence.
At a press conference.
Dave!
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh... Hi.
You ever use it?
What's that?
You're kidding.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Where are you going?
How were you gonna get home?
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
That's a secret.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
It was okay?
What?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I never thought I'd...
So this is it?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
Dios mia.
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
What'dya get?
Tricks...Jesus...
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Charlie Dalton.
How was dinner?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Yes sir.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
You know what really excites me about you?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Nuwanda?  Please?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Where'd you find them?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
What happened?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Well, sure!
Chris!
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
What is that?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
Again!  Louder!
LOUDER!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
You really think I should forget her?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Where are you going?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
But father, it's not fair.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Father!
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
So what do you think of my father?
What is it then?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
From you?
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Put more into it!
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Not an option.
Hanover, listen...
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
What other bunch?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
I'm not rich people.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
I don't know where it is!
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
What did you do the my kids!!
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
I mean...where is everbody?
Where are you going?
Someone's back there.
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
Fucking women, man...
Ammo! Get the ammo!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Tell him, Vince!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
That's new, isn't it?
Whee-uu!
He's real bad, Nick.
I have to go.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
How was huntin'?
Get anything?
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Where's it gone?
Sal.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda...
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
But --
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
No-o-o!
Nick?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
You think we'll ever come back?
It's ahead, by the tree.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What are you, hoping?
Forget Sal.
How's Linda?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Where's Vince?
Great. That's great.
What's that noise?
What's that noise?
What?
It's Merle, Sal.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Yeah?
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
My man Dubbs.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
You're working a partner on this.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I want to stop aging.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I don't want to hear anymore.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
Just great.
You okay?
You my partner?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
How then?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
She's pretty.
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Rip Van Winkle.
How do I look?
Sanchez...?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
I'm going to be a policeman.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Belle --
You know that you're in my house.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Where did it come from?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Jabez -- help!
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Mary--
Mary -- what would you do?
But I'm glad to be home again --
Worried!
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Why don't they come --
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Ma -- is she? --
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
What's that?
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
You're all right, Argyle.
One of yours?
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Hans, he killed by brother --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Bad for your health anyway.
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Hans.  Your Hans.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
How long?
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Is that him?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
These seats come out?
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
It looks like a whole roast.
What guns?
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
How are you doing?
So... that sure is something.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
That's it.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
Who's this?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Okay, give us the women.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Okay, what do you give me?
Yeah ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Hey... let him out!
What's the matter with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
Where's the air conditioning?
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
What is it, Sam?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I didn't eat any pizza.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Where's the money?
It's the cops.  Shit!
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
We'd kill ourselves.
What'd he say?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Hey, you okay?
Hey, let's get ready!
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Did Pop come down?
Robbing a bank.
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
Morning.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Hello?
Yes.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
Really? Did you play in a band?
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
Can you tell?
Many times.
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Fast and or furious.
Where is Domino?
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Yo!
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Mookie.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
No, you the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
It's been about a year.
How long?
I thank you.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
How come you're not at Sal's?
I'll see you out.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
How many you say?
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
ML?
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
I would like to get paid now.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Do we now?
How much?  How much do I owe you?
Keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Before I get off work.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
It's cold.
Later for you.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
You talk to 'em.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I'm listening.
Some are OK.
Mookie's OK.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Turn it off.
Pop, stop lying.
Take it easy, Pop.
You're it.
Hi.
Excuse me?
O'clock?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
I think it's just over there.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Where did you learn that word?
No.
I didn't know that.
I don't know. Owwww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
I made the polar bear pants.
A float!
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Wait, wait!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
TURK, leave him alone.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
I'm so close I can feel it.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Have you got what I want?
How was that?
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
What?
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
You said "aloha" twice.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Knock knock.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Oh, just like the President.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
What's that you're saying?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Don't touch my mother...
Remove her gag!
What's in the box?
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
You mustn't speak of...
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Who are you?  What do you want?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Don't worry.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
And, cut...
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
I don't understand.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
So, Mr. Johnson --
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
What are you making?
Oh, it's you again.
You look beat.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
So have you always lived in L.A.?
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
You know, to make the legs move --
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
What do you love her or something?
How's your mother?
Oh, Al ... This is just...
So?
Ed, can I see you a second.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Yeah?
Leave her be.
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Both.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
Hey, Lou.
What do you want?!
Ha!
What are you doing?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Shari, I really like you...
So...?
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
There's a list.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
I need to talk.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
It's not their fault.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Polish acrobat.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
You brought the girl!
... Ray?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Come on, Ma.
You know what your problem is?
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Hello.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Can I help with anything?
Ohhh...
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
El/ella -
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
what?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You're kidding, right?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Looks good to me.
Thanks for everything.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Yes?
Plenty of pep, too.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
I want you to do something for me.
What a surprise.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
More this way.
points at the motel.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Right now?
Three twenty-five.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
These are private -- these are for us.
Who put you up to this?
What do you want?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
That obvious, huh?
Somebody hit you?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Did they deserve it today?
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Where are we going?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Dudley.
What?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
What do you want to know?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
You're wrong.
No.
No.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Something like that.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Glasses.
So what's the point?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What are you going to do?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
A vulgar term, but yes.
No.
I'm curious about you.
You sound like you mean it.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Do you have any proof?
It seems like my Susan, but...
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Around.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Was it a party?
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
What'd he give to you?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Yes.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Wait. What do I do?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if--
I'll pay you.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
None of your business.
I intercepted phone calls.
They're here.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Gimme that.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Reynolds.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Who's calling?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Remain calm.
Because my life is being ruined.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Anything at all?
For your wife?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You should take this seriously.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
I'm sorry.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Who did you work with to get the--
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Stacy?
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
It wasn't me.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
My suitcase--
And then what?
DePinto?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
How can I be sure.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
You being audited?
That's temporary.
I'm gonna fix it.
I've never met him?
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Hey!
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Robert--
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Where've you been?
Why don't you give 'em a call.
No, but they took my blender.
Jerry--
They're framing me.
You gotta--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Turn yourself in.
It's been a few years.
What is it you want?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What about the tapes?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
Yes sir.
No sir.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Federal Express?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Arabic?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Why did you hold his collar?
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Why did he bring you?
Why did you hate me?
You're wearing the thimble.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Very well.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
If I could just see some identification.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
How are you?
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
No.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Hello.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Oh.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's Canadian.
Excuse me -
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
What do I do?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Will you come with me?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
This is wonderful!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
No.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
We've got to catch him in the act.
Mr. MacDougal.
I don't want to waste your time.
You disappeared.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
For God's sake.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
But--
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
What the hell do I do now?
What the hell was that?
And good morning.
Nice spot.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Someone was expecting that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
On what? Another job?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Aren't we early?
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
We did it.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
Okay, you're a thief.
What?
Your share.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
The Mask. Where is it?
Oh my god, I thought--
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Peoples China Bank.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
That was a lifetime ago.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Come on.
Hang on.
Put this on!
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
--You're a cop.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
You two make quite a couple.
She's calling the shots now.
You'll just have to have faith.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
My friend, you always surprise me.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Where've you been?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
How does someone get meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
What's chromium?
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Five million dollars?
And get someone to help around the house.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
She insulted me!
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
And if you had to guess ...
So why would PG&E offer it?
Fuck Kurt.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Ross.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
What's going on in there?
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You're around every afternoon?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
What's going on?  What are you doing?
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
More than you need me.
Thank you.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Someone stole my stuff.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
My lord.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He will learn patience.
Will he finish what he begins?
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Barks at Han.
Give me that!
Because of my father, I guess.
Yes sir!
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
Our destruction?  Who?
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
There's something out there!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
About what?
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
Get out of here, Lando!
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
I'll take what's mine now.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
We've got to find Luke.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Closer?!
A tremor!
What??
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Where are you going?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
I have followed my feelings.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Will they die?
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
It won't get through the blockade.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
What, Lewis?
With food?
Primitive?
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
I tried...
Where is he?
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Not you?
She's in the green.
75% power.
Plissken...?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Who?
The freeway.
Well, I'll think it over.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Good day to you, sir.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
Arthur.
He can be no other.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
A king must marry, after all.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
What is this place, Merlin?
But, I'm here.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Why can't you be my champion?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Me?
The law forbids it.
Why didn't he kill us?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
You provoke me, Merlin.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Here.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Thank you.
Excuse me Miss?
How are you today?
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Where?
On what?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
People get tired.
Oh my God!
All done.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Karras.
Goodnight Dims.
Do you like films?
Withering Heights.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You'd like that?
No now.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
I'm all right.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
No.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Shut up!!
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Who?
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
It's my goddamn car!
Yeah, come on in.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
My brother and I. One each.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
When they coming in?
What's the gig?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
That's not the point.
Jack.
Count it.
Count it.
So we on tomorrow night?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
I made her nervous.
What's with Charlie?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
What was it like?
Sure, why not.
That's what we agreed.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
You're getting cold feet about this.
Awe inspiring.
You hit me.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Oh, brother.
You all right?
Hey, Frank.
Just a lucky guess.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Unless you want the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What's the matter with you?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
Couple years.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
What?
Cancel, Frank.
What disease?
What?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Stay off it.
You weren't there.
I didn't hear you come in.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Yeah, fine.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
You sure?
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
This where the auditions are?
You're an hour and a half late.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
What-?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Where's your dress?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
Come on.
Come on.  We don't have much time.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
A seven.
Save it for your wife.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Fucking.
Give me that.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Great?
Oh yeah?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Got another song for us?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
And you don't?
Is that the way it is?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
So why's he do it?
Can't sleep?
What's the matter?
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Soap convention.
The both of them?  In there?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
The recent past.
How do you know?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Big piece or little?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
You mean if I get sick?
Fine work, Jon.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
Hey, bro ...
So?
I'm late for surgery.
How did he expect to do that?
How's Loomis?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
When did you start smoking?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
The hospital.
What is with you tonight?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I'll deal with her later.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
That’s right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Take you, for instance...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
C’mon Jack...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Miss me, Jack?
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
What're you talkin' about?
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
Jack...don’t even start...
How can you do that?
No?
Excuse me?
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Say it, Jack...
Maybe I should wait...
You really are incredible...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I could stay here forever...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
You can’t go!
Mrs. Peterson.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Don't you have anywhere to go?
That’s totally see through...
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I can't take this.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
We're working as hard as we can --
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed? ... Sue?
What did you wish for, honey?
About me?  How sweet.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
What are you doing --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Leonard, how's the feed?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
What are you doing here?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Just one, General...
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Shouldn't you answer that?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
Such as?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Doctor, what's wrong?
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
But that isn't possible.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
It's against my better Judgment...
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I can't tell you.
May I?
Atomic fuel?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
How's it look?
That's it...
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
This is a new car, then, sir?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
One of us pays the other for half.
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Three people. In Brainerd.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Any others?
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Both of these.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Just a general way.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Where you girls from?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
Yah.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Mr. Lundegaard?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Yah.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Stan Grossman called.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
We're good to loan in.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
No, see -
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, I just -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
No, that's okay.
...What can I get ya?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Nope.
Yep.
Hello?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
And this guy is...
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
Yah.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Was it reasonable?
Uh-huh.
And his wife?
The first rule of Project --
What... ?
There's no one else here.
You are a moron.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
We need to talk.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
I'll take the parasites.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
That's the idea -- we split them.
I'm just on my way out...
What are you doing here?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Make sure.
You... don't have to... leave.
When?
I don't know.
Is that what you're calling it?
I'm sorry, I...
Marla...
Tyler...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
It's getting exciting now.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
I don't... think so.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
I don't follow...
Huh?
What's that?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
I don't know about this.
But a good strange.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
What are you reading?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
What?
You want to finish her off?
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
I feel sick.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What the hell ... ?!
I'm not asking you to.
This conversation...
Why do people think anything?
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You took me to the house.
You have jobs.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
One minute.
What?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Biology, mostly.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Yeah, how?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
What did you see?
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
I'm not sure I understand.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
You mean Alex Browning.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
Want me to drive?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
It's only the end of June.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
That's why I was there last night.
"It?"
This place?!
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Most kids do, I guess.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Can't you open the door?!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Fag.
Cuticle lacerations.
It broke!
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
You okay?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
We'll check it out.
I'm getting him out.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
You're gonna love it.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
I know.  I go with you.
Look, Co...
What was that?
You pathetic scum.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
How long have you been setting up?
How long before you're fully on line?
Black.  No sugar.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Will it hurt?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Hello....congratulations.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
What?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Parry?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Yes.
Huh-huh.
A list.
Oh, Lydia!
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
No... thanks... Listen --
<u>What</u>?!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
They said you're The One.
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
A quest?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
.....What are you doing?
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
In a bar called Hellfire.
Beautiful night huh?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
Don't say that.
I never say anything I have to.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
You're not going to play it again.
Is it my turn again?
I know you're not.
You like it?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Okay, Ray...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Come on.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
What's your name?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
I just can't look at you.
Sorry.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Daddy's very ill.
Well...  I better let you...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
What questions?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Like what?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Bye, now.
Hello...
Yes, intentionally.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Nothing.
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Wait...
What?
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Where are you going?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Robert, I think you better just...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
I don't think that's true.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Well...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Mass production is what does it.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
Fine.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Who are you?
So watcha doin'?
So what's her name?
A play-ya.
So what you think of me?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Who gives!
Wussup?
Fa what?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
What are you going that way for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
The one with the phat ass?
How does he look up close?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
I think he's 18 or 17.
You here to see somebody?
Yo, that's my girl.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Wonder who his supplier is.
Hey, what are you doing?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
So where do you know Alan from?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Mrs. Smith.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
That's it.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
And what was that?
Then he has.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
I'm the Sufi.
Why are they after you?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
So why pick me?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Will you kill me?
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
My hero.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I really should change.
I mean put clothes on.
Are you still in love with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
What's wrong, Gail?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
What is this....
You can't do that.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
You want I set up?
Muchas gracias.
The door was unlocked.
Where is she?
What did you want under the bed?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Yes?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You're saying you need money.
You going to be okay?
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
How'd you get this from her?
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Hey, they blew me.
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Spunk, come back...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Zuzu, wake up...
My axe!
Ford, you were right!
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, go on...
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Jazz, we're talking here.
It doesn't have to be like this?
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
'Bye, Johnny...
So...
How's everything?
Man, I'm clean.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Il est en retard.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
What's your story?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
What happened to you?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
What are you saying?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
How about a little of the King?
Butch called.
You give him his drops?
I love you, Bud.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
You ready?
Uh, hello?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What are you talking about?
Why?
On the job?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Are you alright"?
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
I'll be damned.
You all right?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Wife around?
You used to be on the job?
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
I'm a slow eater.
It's dark down there.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
What are they saying?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
What do you mean?
Why did you come back here?
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
I never said you were "nothing".
I thought that was the end of the song.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Is that all you found?
Whaddya mean?
Why?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Yes!
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Look, I don't want your money!
Ed...
Maybe you should be moving on.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Tell me!
She's beautiful.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Well?
Oh, my dear God...
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Where's the radio?
What are you doing in here?
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
You had me worried to death!
Everything okay?
I can't swim.
I've got the numbers.
I got you a present.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
I opened thousands of brains.
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
And he was there?
Is it safe?
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not ready.
Shoot him.
Great game.
This could be it.
What about her?
She died.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Your father said you might be here.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
And you've been extremely patient.
Alma Wetzel.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is true.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
I hate the Mets.
What do you mean?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
Yes, Peter.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
You know what.
Do you think he can do it?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Oww!
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
You're a clergyman.
That was lucky.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
What can we do?
You're an ambitious man.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
I would rather march.
Do you find me stubborn?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Assuming we are in agreement?
Have you read his magazine?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Who are you trying to convince?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
How much extra?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
No?  What's keeping you?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
What are you waiting for?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
At least it's nothing contagious.
It's about the Director.
Suit yourself.
I have to know where you come from.
What about this?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
You wish.
That's not the point.
Let's get out of here.
Call German.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Where are we going?
Everybody goes there.
Will you be okay?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
I have your samples ready.
Why have you done this?
Where are you going?
What will happen to the others?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Not that.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Why don't we say we were together?
Does it have a name?
You're angry--
I envy you, Jerome.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
I'm in a hurry.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Really?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
$250,000 right off the top.
Why are you laughing?
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Why?
I don't want to go there.
Why didn't you tell me?
Who's she?
He must have.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
Where are you going?
How much?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Okay.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
What is it?
Come on, come on.
You okay?
How long before this car's hot?
Where's home?
No, I'm not.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
How's Mama and the kids?
How was that?
Come on. How much?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
What's it got to do with you?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
That's not good enough.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
No, don't Jack, don't.
Where's he living these days?
What was bugging Frank?
Yes.
We went about together.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
I want to give you an Oscar.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Have another?
Thanks for coming.
You coming to South America?
It just would. He was always the same.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Where would I find him?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
What happened to you, then?
I'm staying with a friend.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
What you going to do?
So shut up.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
No chance of that.
They're friends of mine.
You coming back?
Oh, that's nice.
Meaning what?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Not suede boots!
What's that? A hundred?
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
What's that?
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You did?
They did.
We're stuck with this...
I, I...I...
...that's right...
He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Someone should rob the office.
What could somebody get for them?
As an idea.
Did you?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
Did I say that?
A buck a shot.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That's ridiculous.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
Do you need five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
And why is that?
Fine.
Yes.
It is dead.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
They aren't?
Where were you?
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse...
Did they...?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
What?
Shelly: get in the office.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
I don't want to go to lunch.
Mmm.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
The people downtown said...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Shelly...
I'm not sure I have two.
Now?  Now?
I wish I could.
Can't do it.
No.
Is that what you're saying?
What happened?
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Get 'em to me!
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
I...
Abso...
You did that?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
"Always be closing..."
Glad to meet you.
You're sure?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Yeah.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Who did she call?
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
I don't understand.
What would have elapsed?
What's going on here?
No.  She told me "right now."
What are the police doing?
They took some of the con...
You closed him yesterday.
It went down.  I filed it.
I have the stuff from last year's...
We had a slight burglary last night.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Did you like your party?
Do you like them?
Will you take me?
Why do you have to go?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Is Kay coming?
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Goddamn bitch.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I don't want to stay here...
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Oh, 'scuse me.
I never met them.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
Beautiful.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Where's my wife?
Will you tell him?
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
What was it, so I'll know.
Was it a boy or a girl?
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Yeah, but don't worry.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
What the hell are you talking about?
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I had no idea...
Why don't you sit down?
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
You're a considerate young man.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I'm talking about Italians!
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
And your name is --?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Does that surprise you?
So we understand each other?
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
What was that about?
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
That only leaves the rest.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
So it is going to happen after all.
Why?
You okay?
I'm up.  Thanks.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Where's Betty?
Then take the pills.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Who was that at the door?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Yes?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Then the rumors are true?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can that count as one question?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
You didn't?
What about?
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
They gave you only four days?
Sound it out for me.
I know you --
You want to come along quiet?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
I know you.
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
What do you want from me?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
When'd you get to town, Raines?
It just ain't happening --
okay ...
Diane 1.
You mean the poor --
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
Any word, Kip -- ?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
How you know that?
He's in some trouble ...
You getting my checks ... ?
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
We'll take it...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
You goin' home?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
Kip -- ?
You okay -- ?
So what are you gonna do?
You don't think so, huh?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
You okay -- ?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Shit ...
Take it back, Freb --
How's it going?
What's with the look?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
And here I am...
And you got some Italians -- ?
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
No ... ?
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Unlock your button ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Whatever do you mean?
Is he still working here ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
What happened to Sway?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What do you want, shithead?
Why don't you leave him alone?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Anybody!  You understand?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
What do you do?
I'm gonna need some money.
Henry.  Wake up.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Stop! Stop!
We've got to help each other.
Then you're safer in here.
Paulie's gonna make him?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
What happened to you?
Where'd you find such creeps?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
No way! You're kiddin'!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
She didn't do it again did she?
How's the woman?
I guess so.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that true?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Chuck, let's go.
I'm not sure--
Will you take a check?
Codebreaking.
And what do you see?
No, there's a limit.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Yes. Under two conditions.
--That edge!
Shall we start the, uh...
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
What are you smiling at?
I can come back.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Sean.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Why me?
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
Do you know when you'll be back?
How about one now?
Who is he?
You're right. I know.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I might understand that.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Yeah, I read those.
That must have taken you a long time.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
Well, are you going out again?
My wife's dead.
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Where were you?
They could see that I meant it.
Do you think you're alone?
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
What?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
You want to read it?
The wrench, why?
Don't fuck with me.
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Free?
How was that?
I bet you have a great family.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Want me to take a look?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Just for fun?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I don't know. I just feel it.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yeah.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Lots must a died, too.
Maybe the road's out.
Short fella. Pale face.
I didn't see nothin'.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Want to work?
Two and a half cents.
Deputy sheriffs.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
That's the way it is.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
She's settlin'.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
But we can still do it, honey.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Sure do.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I stay in my own yard.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
How 'bout Granma?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Where you think you're going?
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
But will it--hurt the baby?
We gonna live here?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Ma, you sick?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Got any more, Ma?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
They know he got hit in the face.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
You can have this for ten cents.
Tommy?
They gone.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Well?
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Morning.
Can you pick peaches?
You're so funny...
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Remember high school?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
I want to be an actor.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Tell me about yourself.
What's your business?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Are you going to the reunion?
You met people.
Yes.
Are you there?
You look beautiful.
Not the other way around...?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
What if I come back?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
What else? Say more.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
They blame you for the compromise.
No, I don't have one.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
So what happened to you?
Debi's house.
He sells BMW's?
What the hell happened to you?
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Doesn't matter.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
The answer's no.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Just make yourself comfortable.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
I don't believe this!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
That's not true!
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Why should they?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Great!
David?
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
What if she doesn't want to go?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Good night.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Yeah, what?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Where does this go, Diane?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
Frank's a good man.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Why do you always wear that hat?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Are you afraid of anything?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
"... and I said that"...
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Long enough.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Secret Service!
Welcome to our show!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Who's that?
Dead.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
How was school?
What did we learn in school today?
Shit! Come on!
Talk to me.
I found it! I found it!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Two days.
Oh, shit! He got me.
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell is going on?
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Name your stakes.
We need your help.
Thank you.
How?
There they are!
Ready?
Excuse me.
Gill.
Hello?
There's a new virus in the database.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Die, dickweeds!
What? whatwhatwhat?
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Any questions?
Phreak?
A hacker planted the virus.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
What is it? What's wrong?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
Who's that?
You think she stands a chance?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Why shouldn't I?
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Jamie, what happened?
What?
I thought you said you were ready.
Had enough?
Rachel!
Why don't you go make some coffee.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
When he makes that call.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
It's over.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Sure.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Saving the treats for Bob?
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Yes, you can.
Wait a minute here...
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I don't know.
You idiot!
Want a beer?
We're all alone, aren't we?
Yeah, sure.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
What do we do?
Sure...
Where?
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
There WAS.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Laurie, you come with us...
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
She's washing her clothes.
I've given them his profile.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
If you say so.
I see.
Oh, good...
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
...with the affiliates.
We--
Yeah.
Where are you headed?
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Yes.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Page a hundred and twelve.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Elliot!  Don't!
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
No!
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
I am... I did slave all day.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
How about something to eat?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Me?
Elliot lusts after you.
...or films you must see or... 
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
You've been with someone!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
N-n-no, not that.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Yeah?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
That's really nice!
Gee.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
What are you talking about?
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Sometimes she's terrific...
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Boy--
Oh, God...
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Can we, can we go?
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Nobody ever said it.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Really?
Oh, God!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Hi.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
A reward...
A reward for what?
And?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
Well.  Word gets around.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
...you...
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Why me?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Bad beat today.
Evelda Drumgo.
Then you tell me, then.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How crazy is that.
What's new onna street?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Where was the call from.
He escaped...
He don't like popcorn.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
And how would you know that?
Yes, I did.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
And?  Then?
How could you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
Yes.... yes...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
No, I don't get you...
I came to pay my...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
The girl could use some help.
...might I make a suggestion...?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I don't understand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...my love...
I am on the track of...
Hello....?
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
...sir...?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Talia, don't go!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Mine!
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Do you really not believe in God?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Two billion years of evolution and                          ] you're what we've come up with--                            ] "Wichita"--the hot, cool, tell-it-                          ] like-it-is counselor with a dark                            ] side.                                                       ]
So, are you a cheerleader?
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
All right.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Things are going to change, Earl.
I was talking with someone!
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
What do you want from me?
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
Mute!
What is this shit?
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Your son's dead and you love him.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You know what I want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
We on tonight man?
Is it sleeping, dude?
You two....
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Hello!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
I'm educating myself!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
You have it.
Look, Mother!
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
Mummy!
I think I'm dying . . .
That.
John has fallen in love with me!
I think I'm going crazy.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Mummy!
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Of course, yes.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
GWEN?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Dreams?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
The bathroom!  For two days?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Nothin'.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
It's not right, Gale...
What is it?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
He lost a shoe!
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
I didn't ask him.
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Where are these toys of yours?
How's the new place?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Everything breaks at once.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Mommy!
C'mon, kids, let's go.
I could take a cab on the way home.
He doesn't have a temperature.
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
I think it's time I came home now.
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
Are we gonna buy this house?
What did the thermometer say?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Even better.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Promise?
Really?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Lieutenant?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
Where were you last night around nine?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Maybe myself.
Thank you, Thomas.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Yes.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
I stood up first.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
I cannot stay.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
Why do you stare at me like that?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
No.
Yes.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why not?
On the back it has--
Be careful, Conner.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
It has to be.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
You know it's not safe here for you.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
You kept it?
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
I guess so.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I guess not.
The car.  All you want is the car?
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Not if they're looking at something else.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That you, Talley?
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
Can you identify this man?
You have his address?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
How did you get this number?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I need to work out some stuff.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
We can't carry him.
What?
Kevin left without you.
Thanks for the shirt.
Are civilians inside?
What's going on?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
That's enough.
Where are they?
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Do it.
Sounds like you know the job.
He says that his father's hurt.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
The kids are in here!
Is my daddy okay?
Where are my children?
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
Paul!
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
You want to pay me?
Give me it.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
I don't understand.
They fired a rocket at us.
What is it?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Satellites.
He did.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You will tell them the truth.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Very good.
What do you mean George?
Let's go.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
There are no more rooms.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Perfect timing.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No.
They do not have your connections.
How can we help him.
They are being evacuated.
I have to go out to get food.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I have a confession. When we met...
I had you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
A little longer, Paul?
Oh, my babies.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Rutaganda's place?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Paul, are you there?
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Jesus H. Christ!
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
What?
Excuse me?
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
What is it? What's in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
What? Deep down inside?
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Don't think it's even an issue.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Jesus!
-- wit...nesses --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
You think this is fucking funny??
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Do something!
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Vannacutt!!
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
What're you talking about?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Fascinated.
Well, I don't.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
It works.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Excuse me?
-- hey! --
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
What do these ingredients mean?
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
I want this one, daddy.
What's he doing daddy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
...set up some more things.
The heater's here.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
I'm fine.
Are you all right?
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Maura.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
We'll never know for sure.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Where did you find this?
There's something in there.
Hello?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Something bad.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Uh-huh?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Every day.
You gonna buy?
Thank you.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Oh, I don't ...
That was beautiful.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Cameras?
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Did I miss anything?
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
That was close....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Welcome back to Vinci.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Hit me with your best shot.
I'm going to find out.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
What have you been doing?
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Way to go, Anna.
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
This is the worst night...
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Something short.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
That smart?!
...Hello?
Ol' satchel-butt...
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
Oh, is that it!
...What happened?
Sid found me the icepack.
...Certain people are --
What a beautiful thought.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
For Pete's sake, Norville!
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
As a three-dollar bill.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...Why, this is worthless.
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Oh, geez.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...education, were you?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
I got gas, Bennie.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
She's got other problems, of course...
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
I'd love to.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
You're single?
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
But don't you have to work?
That doesn't sound like him.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I suppose so.  Yes.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Wesley!
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Benjie!
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
What do you think?
You all right there?
I... I think I am...
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
What?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
What's for dessert?
Don't start.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It's a starting place.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Ready to go?
Elena.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Hi dad.
Classes?
See you.
Here.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
But...
What?
Good shit.
It's what?
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Mikey Williams?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
I suppose. Why?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Please don't.
Reverend Edwards.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Where you going?
Flame on, asshole.
What?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Geometry?
I don't ever want to see you.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Hood residence.
Mikey was looking for you.
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Want a drink?
I love you.
Nice kid.
So far.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
It's legitimate.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We're sure it's hers?
I'll call him now.
So?
Randy Stetz?
They're all over everybody.
No way.
Looks like the natives are restless.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
I'm not expecting anyone.
You heard me that time.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Stuff.
How should I know?...
I don't know.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
It was like some big fucking secret!
My arm!
I'm sorry?
I told you that was an accident!
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
I have not spoken to him...
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Then blame the one who made her...
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
But you're the fairest by far.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Don't Louis --
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Claudia! You did that?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
She's no vampire.
Do you think I would let them harm you?
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
Let's call that a start.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You're sure?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Shall we go on?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
You promise to care for her then?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Storm season?
Listen to me. He's here.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Say yes.
No means yes.
But, he said he'd try.
I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Karaoke -- perfect.
Karla!
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Be careful, Julie.
I don't know...
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
I love it here.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
You sure?
I'm sorry.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
You sure it's okay with you?
What do you mean, Julie?
What? What are you talking about? Where?
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
I'll come with you.
To a great weekend --
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Jeez, that's a full carat --
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Where'd Estes go?
Well ——
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What are you doing?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
What if he is?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
Theodosia.
What is her illness?
This girl --
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
It makes me fear her.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Get that ladder up here.
Stand back.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Go through with what?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Is this the place?
Hi, Daddy.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
What boat you sailing on?
Uh-huh.
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
George! George!
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
You want a martini?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
How's that?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
No, George, don't . . .
I know, but . . .
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Holy mackerel!
Those Rockefellers!
Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Well, what about all your other friends?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Well, hello.
Too young or too old?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
What'd you wish, George?
Oh, no.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
After that, who cares?
Hi.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
How about that one there?
You can?
Come on, you guys.
Great!  Find one for me.
My hair's getting wet!
Sure you do -- you win either way.
No.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
The lighthouse?
Where're we going?
But the island!
I don't know.
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
On your own time?
Chief....
Positive I.D.?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Untie that rope.
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Dad, I'm sorry....
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Okay, so that's it.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
Where the hell were you?
Mmmm.
Eat Cheerios.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
I know what you're going to say.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What're you doing?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Did he raise the Kids?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hi Dad.
It killed her.  It ate her.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Me neither.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
The wind drift is lateral.
Right after, the Kids went out?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Be careful....
What about me?
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You're going out.
I want to go with you!
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Yeah.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, Doctor.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Sure am.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
My imagination isn't that good.
And what else is bothering you?
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Are you scared?
It's romantic down here.
What's wrong?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Change your mind?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
They said you'd be here.
It's too soon to move him.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Come on.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Somebody better get down there!
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Me.
I am.  You're not.
Go where?
You can get killed!
Why?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Musclehead?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Isn't this fun!
Told you you'd like it.
Let's go, let's go!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Gotta sneeze.
Yes, there is goes.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
No, South Georgia.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Reach for the limit I always say.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Took it this morning.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Close the door.
Sweetheart....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
You want to try your hand at something...?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Stop that....
That hurt....
Are you all right?
We don't want any....
A big one....
Yes!
I like Grandma's cooking....
I'll be in to read you a story.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I want you to get out of the water....
I want you to give up your work....
You're having a good time....
It's late....
You hungry?
No....
It was no accident....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
How do you like flying?
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I could take some time off....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I'll get it back next time.
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Can't this thing go any faster?
What happened?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I stuck them on, man....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Bad boy....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I invited you...
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
And it's always worked?
How long?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I'm coming...How close is it?
I don't like it....
What about Carla's gig?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
Holy Christ....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Who grows more beautiful....
She's in management....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
How about any guys on your staff?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
There's nothing in the files?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Did he shut you down?
Stop it.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Jesus. What are you doin?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
I know what a "witness" is.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Can I see your hands?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Have you been here long?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Oh.
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I know what you're like ..
Ross told me.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You know? How do you know?
Has he got your aunt's address?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Interview over, Blattis ...
When did John divorce?
What does that mean?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I just heard.
Didn't hear it.
Oh Jerry.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Oh no.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
It's all going to work.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Oh my God.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Truth?
Well.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Sure you're okay to drive this?
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
I heard.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
No, I air-dry.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Not everyone has what you have.
I'm sorry I asked.
Why not --
I think so.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Oh, tell the story.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
You gonna get that --
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
I'm fine.  What's up?
... dick?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
I don't see any.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We can't just...
What did you say!
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
I don't remember
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
We should try fishing again.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
You had the phone the whole time?
PAUL!
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
I don’t know.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Is it a rex?
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
I CAN GET HIM!
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Hmmm.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
How did you know?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
Any damage?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Resentful.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
I don't believe you.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
But he's the head of InGen!
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Hi, Dad.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Well, is he?
What are you guys gonna do?
What is that?
Where's the power and radio setup?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
Their what?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What do they want?!
No.
Come on!
Because it exists.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
Can you set up?
So what's your story, Nick?
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
You've got to be kidding.
Phones are out too.
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
What?  No menthol?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Come on, let's go.
C'mon on, this way.
And scary.
Oh, imperfections?
Faster, faster!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Yes?
Hola, Juanito
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Can't you stop these things?!
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim!  Lex!
It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Your silence intrigues me.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
I'm a hacker!
Fifty.
No, but...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
You think that's going to work?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
How long will he need to be asleep?
Cute waitresses?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Uh-huh...
You're not going to be there?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
We're down to seven minutes.
Are you all right?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
My assistants, I presume.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
It's my last and final one.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Was there something else?
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
... A piece of paper ...
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What's the matter?
All these in the last year?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Then that's the place for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Get the hell out of here.''!
What have you got there?
Father!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Ann ... Ann!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Did you see her?
What's that?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Uh uh.
Why? She's a junkie.
Guess!
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Why isn't he locked up?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Oh no, I don't think --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Well do you think it was him?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You said it was!
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
What's the matter?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Is that all you have to say?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
You and I -- a relationship.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Where'd you spend last night?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
What?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Where, how?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
That who?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Well --
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Have you discussed this with them?
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Does that distress you?
What does?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What do you like best about her?
Mom, I mean dad...
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
I want a pizza.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
I don't think so.
Sleep tight.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there Burger King?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Did you wish to?
And what is your present salary?
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
And how did you find his work?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Is that...permanent?
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Where are you going?
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
And?
How should I know?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Yeah.
You're on your own, understand?
You ever think about getting married again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
Goodbye, Kundun.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Yes.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
How big is Tibet's army?
Is that big?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
I am scared.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
They will take Lhasa next.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Please, come in, so cold.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Me?
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
It is a story, you decide.
This is Britain.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
Tell me.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Like my mother.
You killed him.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
We are here on official business.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Was he a good man?
At school they'd always say "go" first.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
I got something on the screen.
You take care.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
It's too dangerous for--
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
He's mooing.
It was... something meeting you.
No.
Thanks for your help.
I wouldn't.
This is a little different.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
With what?
They don't believe her.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
They're coming right in.
Did you get him?
Kelly.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I had a great time last night. Again.
That's not what you came to say.
Hey.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
This is what we do?
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
No.
Myra.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
What girl?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I am, yes.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Reasonably so. Yes.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Ahhh... Why?
They all were.
The death of my father.
No. Tell me why.
Then tell me how.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
So you ran away...
But you could. You did.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Starling.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
What...?
Why didn't you bury those people?
The Ottawa are gone.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Mr Poe?
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
What?
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
How far is it, scout?
What?!
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
That is the truth!
How long?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Got a reason to stay.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
You mind if I take a look at this?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Why Sixpack?
Doc eat already?
I thought they were your friends?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Your suit, Becky!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
We're on backup air.
Excuse me, sir...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Forty-eight hours!
Who else...Sixpack.
Yes sir...
Still bothering you?
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
What is it?
It needs blood?
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
I'll kill him!
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Bacon, see what we got.
Well?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son, have a look in his locker.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
What are you doing?
Is that you, Dean?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?

It must be this one.
And the weed?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
That's it all done, we are off.
I hope this is the right move.
There's nothing in it!
Who's this fat man, then?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
Go on.
Hello, can I help you?
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
What have you come as?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
How many wings have they got between them?
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
How do you think you're going to make a living?
And what did she do?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Well?
Do whatever they tell you--
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
We're not running a dating service here.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
A .45--
Yeah, well--
Best part of the job.
350 pounds.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
So I'm part-Indian?
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Tanks, huh?
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
This place is a gold mine.
Right.
Cliff--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Treasure hunter?
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
Black Seminoles?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Is very beautiful, your car.
You have somebody else out there?
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
When we backed you--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
No.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
Besides my father, I mean.
You thought any more about our murder?
Charley Wade.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Sam--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
He had the club out on the old trail road--
He squeezed money out of you?
And my father?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
She finally got in--
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
It was for personal consumption.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
So what are we gonna do about this?
Yeah?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
You're out early.
The Republicans?
Yeah.
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
How come you don't took familiar?
Mister D'Amour?
That's Butterfield...
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Hokey enough for you?
How'd you spell that again?
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Will you come to him on your knees?
He's with us...
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Sorry.  You asked.
He's good.
How did it go today?
What did you find?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
...yes?
Valentin?
Bad show last night?
Sure.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Are you finished with me?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
I saw him in Vegas once.
What's the difference?
Any movie stars buried here?
Why'd you come here?
What for?
I want to speak to Dorothea.
Leave her alone --
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
The Puritan?
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For an introduction.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Call me tomorrow.
Have we met before?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Maybe... I... don't...
What is?
Yes! Yes!
And?
You could still help me do that.
What about you? Why are you here?
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I don't want to go home.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Did I scowl at you?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh, for her show?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Yeah? But look at you.
And marriage, does that get easier?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
I know.
You are.
It's for my daughter.
Nice one.
Where's your husband?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
You're leaving right now?
That's not what I'm talking about.
You know, eat healthier.
It's ok.
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Ok.
Great.
You smell weird.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
It's amazing  there!
I missed you.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
I spaced out.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
What're these?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Father, please don't die.
May I help you?
And also that...
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So...what did you think of the tape.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
We need to talk.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Get up!!
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
He was trying to tell me something.
Oh, Peter.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
He could see me.
Thanks again for everything.
That's not funny
What?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Engaged.
There you go.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
What?
Can I take your coat?
Careful.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Hello.
Nah.
This brother from my college.
You do.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
You ever been in love?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
But?
What's that?
So what are these Spanish guys like?
You ever think about going back?
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
And?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
That's it, give it your best shot.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
See you made it.
You don't look half-bad.
When'd you get this?
What'd it say?
It's okay, little baby.
Clothes.
Yo, where's the "D"?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
I...can't.
Hey.
You weren't at my game.
Can we talk?
Least you got your priorities straight.
Never had to.
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Actually, I don't...
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
I heard enough.
What will this prove?
Give it yourself.
We should head over.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What is this?
Later when?
Why not?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You work too hard, Pop.
What people?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
I just told you.
So what are you gonna do?
Still is, so let yourself out.
I ain't a damn liar.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
From your mouth.
What do you want?
Yeah.
What surery?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --

Yeah.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Bye, bye, Claudia.

Picky, picky.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
You don't need braces.
He has Phil right now.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I would just want to clear some things up:
This isn't meant --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
And what did your parents do?
And your father?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
It's not your given name, right?
Are you asking me a question?
Is he in pain?
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
What? What? What now?
There's no disturbance.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
No.  I said that.
I preffer to stand.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I can't fuckin' do this.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
I love you.
I don't think I want that.
How do we do this, then?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I love you so much.
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
No.
Hello?
She's asleep.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
I'm Bob.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
Are you on drugs right now?
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
What would you like?
Bottled Water?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Be ready at two --
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
C'mon, man.
You coulda been in front --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Hi.
..sorry...
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Wh-- Wha--
Poor Phillippe!
But --
Bloody hell...
Then to the Bastille.
No!  Stop --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Mother of God!
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Coming?
We go someplace dangerous.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
But -- are you sure?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Thanks, but not for me.
Raoul is everything to me.
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is that?
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Did they kill him?
Sire!  I -- How did you --
The food doesn't please you?
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
What do you think?
What the hell happened?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
What did the six-toes have to say?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
Zydowski.  It's about time.
Where is he?!!
Captain?
I had it all on tape...
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Jesus, man...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I've got a better idea...
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Where are you going?
No.  It wasn't like that!
What about him?
I wouldn't presume to try.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
In thirty-five minutes.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
Who is it?
What'd it say?
When are you coming back?
Will?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
'No' what?
Are you a man?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Come in.
Yes?
I want to see Lecktor now.
In a holding cell.
He's right-handed.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
Hello, hotshot!
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
Maybe we should give it some time...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
What do you want?
Yes. Who are you?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Are you gonna kill him?
She got all right?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
And?
Why should I tell you?
What disadvantage?
Pictures?
I don't have one right now.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I don't believe in God.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
Sitcom...?
No.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
We were just trying to push the envelope --
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
My hair is coming out.
Cue the commercial!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
GET OFF!
It's so dirty.
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
We had a deal!!
That was a really hot house!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
They are dead.  In either case --
The sewers.  Of course.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Weird.
You got the money?
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
You don't, do you?
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
No, it's all right.
Why you're here?
Five.  Since I've been here.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Just get me outta here.
Morpheus...
Who's coming for me?
Holy fucking shit!
Do you still want to meet?
Why not?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
... am I dead?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
I thought it wasn't real.
Do you understand, Neo?
And she knows what?  Everything?
She helped you?
I'm going to make the call.
You're the Oracle?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
What's funny?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
Hello, Neo.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
But an Oracle can.
Did you go to her?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
That I would have to make a choice...
What?
No, you're not.
No one has ever done anything like this.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Tank, you're hurt.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Operator.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Well, we want good stuff.
Yeah.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
May God be with you.
Where to?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Nervous?
Hey, come on...
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Panther...
Waddaya think?
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
I think we should see your uncle.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
What's a'matter?
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Diane, how are you feeling?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Please take it.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
No.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Come on.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Can you spare it?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
What, honey?
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
From the Korean War.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I don't like cake.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Honey --!
...This shit's not bad.
And that?
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
No.
No, I don't --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Well, I guess he's found one.
Yeah.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Yah.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
The Board is waiting.
How long you here, Joe?
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
I am Joe.
Oh goodness, no.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Yes...
Has her pain abated?
No, I'm not.
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
-- Could you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
...No.
I like you in a black tie.
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'?
Did I say that?
I - uh --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
What a good idea.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Bill --
Joe --?
How about giving a guy a break?
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Excellent.  What is it?
Okay.
Why did you go to the hospital?
Hello, Bill.
I'll be the judge of that.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Thanks.
You're what?
Then what is it?
Which is what?
I don't like what you're saying.
Joe, don't do this --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Please.  Talk to me --
I'm sorry --
Hi, Bill --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Drew's aboard?
Drew told me.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Aw, you're tough.
You're terrible.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
You don't know anything about Joe --
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
How'd you know?
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
...We know so little about each other.
79.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
66.
Hiya.
Condition?
So you're holding my calls?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I like your car.
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Yeah.
It's isolated.
They treating you alright?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Your wife?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Who?
What does he want?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Don't say another fucking word!
My boyfriend told me about you.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
This is your car.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Who?
You really want to find this guy?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
So was he scared?
Prove it.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
She has no idea who I am.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
No, you won't.
So who are you saying he was?					*
Why would I do that?						    *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Bullshit.							*
What was it for?							   *
* Thank you.							    *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
No.  I was in Namibia...
With Sonny.  110%.
Yeah?
Where's the new drop point...?
I got to talk to my ADO...
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
I got the item.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Were you born in Havana?
How's he not your husband?
Mojitas...?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Is this the protective male talk?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
What friend?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Anything?
What do we got?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where'd you go?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Hey, fuck him.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
What's your take?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Yeah.
Where are you?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
So?
You sure?
What flowers?
And...?
Equipment?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do you care?
This the load you lost a while back?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
What the hell did you do?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
I can tell, can't you?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
What's in your socks?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
I'm scared.
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Sold. Let's go.
Two kilos.
Tunnel?
It's there!
Yeah. How's Mom?
How far?
Sixty Lira?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Got a family back there?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Hello, Billy.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Okay?
What?
Oh we... we...
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
What?
Just got some news on Bell.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Never was anybody like you...
Billy, what's the matter?
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Hey, you can't...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
There's some weird shit here.
And a right.
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
You feel anything?
He's special.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
We're no leaving you!
Just inner chambers...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Honey, just leave it.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
No, Jesus, no.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
It's no use! They know we're in here!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
What?
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
This wing configuration. I've never...
My God.
What do you want to know?
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You want me to burn my book?
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
See, isn't this nice?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, I know you've been out.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Marcia, please.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
To win?
You picked another winner!
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
What are you talking about?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
We're due to take off.
There she is.  I got visual.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
An idea, yeah.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
Excuse me?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Very.
Yes, I believe that's right.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
..not in time to save him.
It's the transponder.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Roger that.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
But why tell us?
You knew about Jim?
Donít Jim.
Is he serious?
I'm walking.
What?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Okay...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Claire.
Are you damaged?
Yes.
No sir.
Yes.  I see your point.
I don't quite follow you.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
It's quite out of the question.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why should I?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Merci.
Jack.  Jack.
The package is in the open.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Tell you what?
How was Chicago?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Iíve got a shadow.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Whatís going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
I usually am.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Why don't you take a look?
Such a nice ass.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I have no money!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Cosmo?
Rose, pass the wine.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Here.  Ti amo. 
I'm getting married.
He got hit by a bus.
Here.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
This is good. Uhh...
Where'd Johnny find you?
How'd he die?
Stupid yourself.
Why you talking to me?
I can't believe what is happening.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What did I do?
Why not?
What?
Alright.
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
Why not?
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
It's Johnny Cammareri.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
You never have dessert.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
He's my younger brother.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
WHAT?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Your hair's different.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Do you love him, Loretta?
What about the moon?
I know.
Don't fight.
He should pay.
Don't make yourself sick.
Talk to him.
Loretta...
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Go ahead.
Nerves.
You knew that man?
I guess you can't invite me in?
It's a house.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Rita. Rita.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
I don't know.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
Burn them.
Get away!
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Of course.
None shall pass.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Well, what's that then?
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Well, what are you then?
What is your name?
Ni!
They're nervous, sire.
Where?
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Good idea, O Lord!
The nose?
Exactly.  So... logically ...
He will be soon. He's very ill.
That's easy!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Why?
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Who are you?
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
How?
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Camelot ...
Well, she's got a point.
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Well ... yes ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
They're all saying the word ...
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Sixty.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
And she sent no word down?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll get over it.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
It's what the maids are for.
What's your name?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Mother....
Mama...
By whose authority?
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
Checked and locked, sir.
You'll be sent a message.
Her Highness' Equerry.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
That can wait till the weekend.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Dare say you can be taught.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You sent for me.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Was there never ambition?
Then I envy yo.
They don't see it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
We took a nip of whiskey.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
This is my good John Brown.
What did he want?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
How long has he been this sick?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Read it.
There is one other matter.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Dead?
Maybe he's not dead.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Has anyone seen Greg?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
So where is he?
No, in person.  Now.
What do you mean by "weird"?
It is.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Change the channel!
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
Then where do we go?!
Virgin sacrifices?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Okay.  It's West.
So that's what we almost died for?
Christ...no time...
So how did you do it, Alex?
It's the wrong way!
I'm thinking!
They fired everyone.
Someone's shut off my money!
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
So what's the problem?
Beautiful night.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
... What??
So, what did they say?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Your Aunt called me.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Betty Elms?
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay... but just...just to see.
There's nothing?
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Don't stop!
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
The one of 'em still alive?
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
No.  I haven't seen any.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
Is that it ?
Where are we ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
McCay knows ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
And you believe that ?
You okay ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Where are we going ?
Do you know where you're going ?
What was that ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I thought you made this place ?
You okay ?
Is it over ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
Don't eat at the console.
When I think you're ready.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
Look ! Look !
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Umm, where do you want this?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
This is California, anything is possible.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Visualize a spare?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Seriously.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Yeah.
I will. How's Shelly?
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Never heard of him. 
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Thanks.
What're you saying?
Sure am, who are you?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
I told you it was a long story.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
I know that.
My mother can't have any more kids.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
Vada?
Don't wake up Vada.
Thanks....
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Care for a smoke?
Does it work?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Come and get it.
Woah, watch it!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
What's he smoking?
Hey look!
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Muh??
What's it for?
Well Rose was being very thorough.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
A secret, I like that.
I should do this myself.
Hi!
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Shelly?
Really?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Wanna play?
Danny?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
They're dead?
I need the job.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Harry, I really think she.....
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
This is where we are.
Kiss me.
Did you ahh, love him?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Of course not.
Dad??
When??
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Why not?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
Who's that?
Cause she's dying.
No.
Really?
Who's winning?
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Big Ringo fan.
I would.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Sure.
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Where's Daddy?
No, I'm going home.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Hurry!
If I do it, can we go?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Is that your Dad?
Do you remember her?
Pacifist!
Woah!!
Get up!?
Uh huh.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
He can't do that to me!
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Ben Gay.
Elmer's Glue?
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Excuse me?
What else did he tell you...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
And loving him means loving all of this.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Ex-cuse me?
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Waiter! Check, please!
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You're not eating.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
No accents today.
This thing means that much to y...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Lower.
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
Because I could come...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You got the money?
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Winifred.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Then why are you listening to her -
You have to what?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
What's wrong with her.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
What?
He's going to run for president.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
How much?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
President?
Where are you going?
Come on. He's a crook.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
You bet.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
You want me to wait?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Uh huh.
How do you know?
She had on high heels?
What year?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
And before?
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Doesn't it have a name?
Premeditated murder.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Hello. John Triplette.
What for?
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Where are you going?
How's your stomach?
You know Bill is really mad at you.
We just got a gold record.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
I'm Opal.
Why?
Pleasure
You go to school together?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
What kind of pies do you have?
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Naw, she don't mind.
Divine intervention.
Who's the song bird?
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Say something.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Not to anybody. She sings.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Sorry about that.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Was what worth it?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Says the United States of America.
Where's it parked?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Who?
Are you all set?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Rollin'...and speed!
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Ya know, I was.
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Give her a beer.
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Yeah.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
People seen him 'round.
How 'you doin' man?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Yes, aren't you?
My father's the preacher.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
How about another beer?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
What happened, Duff?
Don't push me, Duff.
What about that girl?
I can see why.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What's wrong?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't look so scared.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Hi.
About ten dollars.
You heard me!
How come you don't hate their guts?
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Where' you goin'?
A whole lot, Frankie.
Good-bye, Frankie.
'See ya.
What happened?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
How long's it been?
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
What the hell is that?
What's an A.I.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
What are you talking about?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Hey, bro.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Never heard of him.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
You're late.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
What about the mainframe's access code?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
How long have I been out?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
...Feels like you.
He projects with neural implants.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Is he going to make it?
Shit...
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Like what?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
How long will they watch us for?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
You're Pam?
Well excuse me.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Forget it.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Hi!
You need my help?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Uhh, no.
Gus?
Oh my god.
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Wow. This must be big.
What!?
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Dorothy Parker--
I love the way she writes.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Boys.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Aloha! Welcome!
Are you having fun?
We followed your instructions.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Yes.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
We're here!  You sent for us!
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Help me with this thing!
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
You're fucked in the head.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You mean a shithead.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
I feel like a jerk.
About not finding any bogey men?
It's gone now.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Yor dad picking the music again?
I'm serious.
I'll need to take her things.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
So what do we do about this creep?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Max, where's Kristen?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Oh God.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
This is nice.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
Just until we get things under control.
Take us there, Kristen.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
My God.
How is he?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
And then I... right.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Oh Jesus.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Why?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I have thought about you.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Yup.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Oh please sod off.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Can I stay a bit longer?
That's not true.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
But... wait... there are things to say.
You disappeared.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Where are you going?
Still loves you though.
Do you want to stay?
That's nice.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
I'll see what I can do.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Right -- want another one?
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Do you ever masturbate?
So I get the brownie?
Buggered?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Does she know you're coming?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Hey.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Which was?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Excuse me.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, Mister Harding?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Get up, Billy.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Is there anything else?
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
What's your name, buddy?
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
That's okay, kid...
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
A bus?
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-H-Help!
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
What for?
I second the motion!
Yeah, Mack?
I'll bet a dollar.
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Did to me?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
Giving up?
So why are you talking to him?
It doesn't help him.
I'm busting outta this place.
I said out!
You can come back later!
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Right!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Jesus God...
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Oh, what's that?
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
How are you feeling?
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Yeah!
Got a cigarette?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Please follow me.
You know, I never got your name.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
He's a patient, Rose...
Hi.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
What kind of crap is that???
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
At this hour?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Whew! Hiya, boys!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Your mother.
Your grandmother?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Were they pen pals?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
...has a prior commitment.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
You're limping.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Why?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Is something the matter?
There's no such thing.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Really?...
I was hoping for the real thing.
Any night.
Wait.
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
What's he do?
Why don't you ask him?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Is that bad?...
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Live happily ever after.
You okay?
Now what do we do?
So?
A phone message.  Only--
Your brother?
What's that supposed to mean?...
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
What did you say to her?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Hi-iii...
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Who said I was going?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
So...
What about Larry?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Where is she?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
Right now?
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
I wish I knew.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's— 
Mm—hmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
See! You don't understand!
It was you, Charley... .
Father Barry.
What happened?  What happened?
I'm with Terry.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
I'd better go in.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like that one?
No thanks... .
Now what are you doing?
Terry!
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
And if you don't?
You're not sore at me?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
I don't rate it.
I've been sittin' in the church.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
My hand.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Every one of 'em... .
Am I on my feet...?
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Now don't give me a hard time.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Better.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Is Johnny in?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
My favorite little cousin.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
What do you mean?
Those creatures..!
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
When!?
I understand, Master
You better hope there is.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
We don't know of anything, Master...
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
No. No! No!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
I want to speak with you, please.
Yes.
Yes.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Do we need him?
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Just that she got away.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
How long you talk to her?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
And she saw you?
You find out?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
You know they gonna set us up.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
What'd you talk about?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Yeah, why?
What do you want to bet?
Who?
Who was the friend?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Boy, it stunk in there.
We still talk, though.
Is that right?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
How'd you get this number?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
So she did help you?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
Take your sunglasses off.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Whose blood you got all over you?
Looks like tonight.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
I know what you're talking about.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
She did, huh.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
You don't remember me, do you?
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Do we have a gun in the car?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You there?
Right now, son.
That was some shit, huh?
You're a fighter?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Thanks, Dad.
He's about to.
You were talking in your sleep.
Was it Foley?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You gonna go get him?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
How do I look, mama?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
Thank you...
What?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Faux goose down.
Foley's got it.
I found a rubber.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Nah, you go on.
Waitress!  Four beers!
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
Get me into a plane!
Where are we going?
They're all over us!
Fun today.  Like old times.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
How's everything?
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Then wh-where do we land?
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Don't get smart with me, son.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Sorry to trouble you.
Win?
What's your name?
You take care, Dorie.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
What?...
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Fook ya!
I have'na been able ta --
Hello, Lilla!
Do you believe in all of that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Welcome to the singles scene.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
What happened?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
And we're here on the couch...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Charlie, how are you?
You really love me, don't you?
What are you doing here?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
What're you doing here?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I thought you were...for a while.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
I beg your pardon?
Terry! Slow down.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I thought I knew everything about him.
Young lady, you're drunk!
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Hi, Dad.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Where have you been?
And the butter.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
You're giving me the creeps.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Like what?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you moved into town.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
What happened to you?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Just out.
What are you talking about?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Is this a good spot?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
It's weird...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
How long have you been here?
Mom...
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
Thanks, Walter.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
What's wrong with you?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
I know that, Charles.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Client of yours?
Congratulations.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
Find a lawyer?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha.
How did they find out?
PARRTYY!
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Beckett?
What?
I'll look over the Q and A.
A regular all-American guy?
Except... you were gay?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Thanks for coming by.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
Do you take risks?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Where's Dad?
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Good school. What year?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Have you changed your aftershave?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Tell me that was you.
Oh, Lord....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Bring the light!
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Hey.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
Smoke screen for what?
So you noticed too?
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Some prophet guy?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
The sled as a shield....
New Mecca....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
King Tut's tomb....
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, what's it look like now?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
How did you know we'd come here?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
As you wish.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Where does the river lead?
Do you have to work tonight?
Now, just a minute --
You didn't think so then.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Which direction?
Any particular reason?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
He's trying to form words.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
I want her.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Of course.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Then there is another jungle?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
It's him...Landon.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
It's humiliating.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
I was wrong.
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
Dawn! That was it!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Must be somebody?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
You wanted to see me sir?
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
No thanks?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
Good evening, Miss.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
How did you meet him?
Bad?
Dance? Tonight?
Certainly not to me.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Then he's got to be a detective.
They're going to arrest me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
Well?
If you're doing all this just for me.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
It buys things, just like any other kind.
No.  I paid him off.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Yes, Miss.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
What this?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
They call me Jeff.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
How are your teeth getting along?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
In case you want to have us followed.
Time for a little chat?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
It could have been an accident.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
You asked me where it all came from.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What do you want?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
You in charge here?
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Where's the shell?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
No suicide.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
May you what?
I never saw it before.
No doubt about that one.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Ye have, have ye?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
So-so.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
How long have you had it?
Right.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
How's Mary?
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Why not stay?
I haven't seen much of you.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
The torture of small children--
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
What would you call it?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
How you figure?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
We're wasting time.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Why should I?
You never were...
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
What?
They don't go for the vault?
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
My name's Johnny Utah!
Bye.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Mean anything to you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
Why us?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
I'll see you there.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
It's... it's not like that.
Who are you going after next, sir?
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
You're joking.
Three hundred.
What's your name, lover.
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Not... quite.
Did you buy some clothes?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
The Rex.
Hello?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Real genuine guy.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I know.  I'm glad.
Right.
You're packing.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
What!?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
Why do you want to know?
Did I wake you?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
Looks slow tonight.
'Lo.
Yeah.
Kit...
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Would you like to try it on?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
Every ship but the four you sent.
He knows I do not love him.
Rest, Highness.
Singed a bit, were you?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why is that, do you think?
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
-- wait, just wait --
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Westley's only faking, right?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
What? What?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Now?
-- yes --
Humiliations galore!
Thank you for everything.
Slow going?
Sorry.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
How old were you?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
I must know.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Let me explain-
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Oooooooops!
But sir, I'm not condem ...
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
Here, don't panic.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Help!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
What was I saying?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Do you think he'll take the job?
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Not.
Do it!  Do it!
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
People can hear you.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
No. At least I don't recall.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
No! Of all...
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Why?
Casharoonie!
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Please!
Yes.
Yes?
Where?
What's the matter?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I was getting to that!
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
What thing could we be in together?
Is Mary... in trouble?
You want me to stay here?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
He didn't come back here?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Where'd you go to college?
You going to wait here for me?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
You're very... kind.
I imagine so.
Only my share.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
No, not like me.
In quite a hurry.
Is anything wrong?
Frankly, yes.
We have a problem.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Barefaced.
I'll take you to...
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
You didn't find anything.
No mother.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He's inherited a fortune.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's that?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
You're losing your blood?
What were you dreaming about?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
There's no hurry. It's early.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
I won't let you say that!
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
We'll be coming to the opening.
But I think these things are beautiful.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Are you giving me this straight?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Meaning what?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
That's what I said.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
That's what I said.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
But I have some friends waiting.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
What was her name?
Mia...?
A place you've never been.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Actually, I am, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Here comes Daddy.
I got an awful toothache.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Neither do I.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Yeah.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
He kissed her.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
So am I.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Well, she's back.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
She hasn't actually done anything...
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, sir.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Is this ill right?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
I got an awful bad cold.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Galley what?
Took your time gettin' here.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
What's the matter with him?
Yes, go on.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Who cares?
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
Kittle...
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Wh... what... ?!
That's sick.
When you planning to cut back on that?
Happy Independence Day.
Birth control's important.
It doesn't say that.
Hey...
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Our resignations.
Maybe.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Can't be worse than you.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Been waiting long?
You suck at lying, Archie.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Why the beach?
Do tell.
You see that?
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
I can't do it, Ben.
Jabba's palace.
Yes, my Master.
As you wish.
They are clear, my Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
The same as always.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
What's going on?
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
What did he say?
We're coming!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
What's he saying?
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
What do you remember?
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
How many languages do you speak?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet.
Oh Janet
Oh....Say something.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Feeling
Dealing
No no no no.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Is everything all right?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
No... I can't!
...Like you?
I can't go out.
Oh, Rocky!
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Owe you what?
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Make your teeth yella --
Makes your breath like garbage.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Please, kid.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Ya nose is broke.
Yo, Paulie.
Ya always in a bad mood --
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
What's ya sister like to do?
Why?
It don't bother me none.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
What's this, Roger?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
They must've taken it off me.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
You?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
So altruistic.
How did you get onto Doom?
Now what?
What's with the dip?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
You tricked me, damn you!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Does this help?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
No better?
Romeo! Romeo!
A challenge, on my life.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Every man betake him to his legs.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Good marrow, father!
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I take thee at thy word.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
By the hour of nine.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Pink for flower.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
We kept it...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I don't know.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
About time!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
I still am.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
It's quite satifactory.
I'd stake my reputation.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Do you have the material?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Then where is it?
Sent it where?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
A means to an end, is that it?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Yeah.
So this is what, a test?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
It's been known to happen.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
He's going back.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
The Irish representative?
You were behind the door?
Do we need anything else?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
I know.
What's the story?
You put everything on the line because you...
Doing well.  This is?
Sort of!
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
What the hell...
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
That's not what I mean.
He's going to be trouble.
Here it is.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
OK.  I love you.
That son of a bitch.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
What?
What do you think about all this?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Anything I can help you with?
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
She's not his type.
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Don't hurt me.
How's work?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Not in the trunk.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Winner six!
Winner!  Four, winner!
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
What?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Carter, get off that stage!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Follow the Rich White Man?
Who?
Slow down, baby.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
Wait!  There's people down there!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
Very nice.
Vegas...
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
No you didn't!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
First class.
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
I didn't know which side you were on.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You know what a phone booth is?!
What is your name?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shut up!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He stole my wheel!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
Help me Rhonda.
Where were we?
Right....
What about them?
What?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You want more?
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Want some?
Like that.
What are you doing here?
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How about a lift home?
How much they want?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
I am so sorry about your men.
What is he up to now?
Got any last minute advice?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Rub your ears.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
They made me put my hat back on.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Getting nervous?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
You're going to be very disappointed.
Really?
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
I don't know.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Lost!
I love you.  I love you.
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Yes, I did.
You were not.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Ya think?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
I'm going to kill myself.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
What happened at the luau?
Let's go.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I hate boats.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
Even when you were young?
I'll wait.
It's delicious, trust me.
Who is it?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
I do.
What was that about up there?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
He lost all the weight... there.
Yes.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
Becky?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Howard.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's you.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Hello.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
All righ...
What are you going to do, Sam?
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
You don't like the one he was now?
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
When's the latest time you were out there?
You'll like it.
Do you want a fruit plate?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
Dad?  About last night?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Great.
Dad!
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Did you call that radio station again?
Everyone at work heard you.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
You look good.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
Is he there?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Well?
Got any more ideas?
How goes it?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
A fighter, huh?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
A meeting?
When?
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
You know I don't think that.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Luís! Come down here!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Bobby?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
What is it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Fuck you.
Oh. Hi.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
I'm kind of busy.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
How you holding up?
What time is it?
I'm hurting.
Don't get carried away.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You want a hit?
What's this?
Okay
What?
But...I've seen you.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
But I just met you.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
I'm sorry?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Now get talkin'
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You got a name?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
You've got no choice.
That's because he doesn't have one.
I thought you'd be happy.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
He's the only one I told.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Tom, quit fucking around.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Find a chaplain.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Yes, sir.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
It seemed appropriate.
Over three-hundred.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Good luck, Captain.
The men said, nine.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Worked, didn't it?
Caen?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
You get a translator, Captain?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And how do you bluff yourself?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Trust me, you're the best.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Who cares?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
Demolition, right?
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
This evening is over.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Thanks, I like yours too.
But you never had a first date.
C'mon, just do it.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I told him to be himself.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Lloyd?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Do you love him?
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Actually, I think that I...
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Whoa.
Thank-you.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Sure I do.
Then call me tomorrow.
I think you should wear that.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
It did?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Did you talk to Corey?
Did you tell anybody?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
What do you want?
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
The guy with the Datsun?
The truck?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I was gonna...
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man
Give me my firebird keys!
Now you're back.
Well, let's find him.
What -
Luck.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
You took my workers.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
What's that?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
This is not my problem.
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How you feeling, all right?
What are you doing?
Thank you.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
What others?
That'd be fine.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
I can do it, Captain.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
What if I said goodbye?
I did that.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
A twist ending if you will.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Yeah?
Not good. How you doin?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
They're roomates.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Who is this?
Who are you?
You're getting obvious.
I'm sorry.
It's good to see you involved.
I don’t know.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I have rehearsal.
He tried to kill her first.
Knock yourself out.
That was good.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Hello?
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
You ass.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Nope.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Did you request this case?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Hmm.
How is that good news?
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
What?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
What's your point?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Your life?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Geez.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
What'd he say?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Where?
Yeah?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
You ready to party hard tonight?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Billy? What the...
No...
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I wanna let go. I do...
Uh-huh.
NO! Don't believe him.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Who are you trying to reach?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why do you want to know my name?
Gotta go.
Listen, asshole...
Is this some kind of a joke?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
So you better leave.
Please don't hurt him.
Don't do this. I can't...
I don't know...
What's his name?
Now for the real question.
But you're doing so well.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
So is Dewey your real name?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What are you doing here?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Casey! Casey!
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Where do you get this shit?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Hello?
Are you okay?
Have a good trip.
Stop. Right there.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Which is you...
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Or a man's mentality.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
TATUM!
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
What's so exciting?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Who said this was murder?
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
Well?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You go to movies at least?
He must have left another puzzle piece.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Does this make it with you?
How did the fire fight end?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
We don't know for sure...
Well, that was money well spent.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
This is a waste of time.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Are you alright?
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
Where's the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Well... what the fuck, man?
No.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
Perfect example.
How's California?
Let's get along...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What good does that do?
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Keep talking.
Yes, sir.
What you want me to call you?
Well, come on!
Good night...Laurie...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Stay out here.
Was your niece about their age?
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Why else?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
I mean the armchair!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Cherry-red Tears.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
And that is?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Hammer?
Well, look here!
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Oh
Follow that boat!
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
Tomorrow.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Are you writing?
The title?
How much?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Most interesting.
No, your marriage bed.
It's a comedy.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Is it going well?
But nothing is happening.
It is over.
I feel a scene coming on.
By God, I wish I knew.
How will it?
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
This is a different one.
God bless you!
And--?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Better fortune, boy.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Even your play.
Moonlight!
Let him be damned for his pages!
Then I will go with you.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
My lady Viola.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
And break her heart and mine?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I'm only asking what you think.
Only on expenses.
No.
You mean immoral.
He's still here.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
What's all this for, more security?
What? Yes, that's fine.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
They know.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Is this being recorded?
Are you recording it?
Well, is it?
Parked outside?
Just one thing.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
That's right.
What?
Yes.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
I thought you stopped going.
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
David hasn't seen him either.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
So?
I wonder how he did it?
Alex.
Be careful.
Sshh.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
We have to talk.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Aren't you going to answer it?
You'll wait in the hall?
What?
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
So, uh...
Can you afford this place?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Of course.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Two hundred pounds.
Expecting anyone?
Who have you talked to?
So let's go.
Eh, I don't know.
In this firm.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
It's nice.
What's it about?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Working nights?
I write about it?
Same as everyone else.
I thought you were in a good mood.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
-- is that what this is all about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I don't know.
She did?
Wow.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Your husband?
No, I know.
She what?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Like what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
No.
I am not!
I went to school with her husband.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
What sort of references do you have?
Pardon me?
George!
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's coming with us.
Did you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Look, either come in or stay out!
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
What are you looking at?
Am I entertaining you?
Me?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
So I'm saying it...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I don't know... Jackie?
What with?
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you know better...
Not yet.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I just... who what?
George --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You've never even been around one.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Yeah, baby...
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
What do you want?
Jill says nothing.
What business meeting?
Now, Jackie --
What difference does it make?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
... well I'm glad you told me.
What? What? What? What? What?
I wish you'd go now.
George...
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
... she's very upset...
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it, George.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Did they have something against me?
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Me!
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
What took you so long?

All right, who're you with? Jill?
I'm coming over.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
Yes.
Who were you talking to?
Here.
Who are they?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
You're really a love -- you sure?
We don't think marriage is important.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
C'mon.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Egypt?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Johnny!
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
You're going?
What's wrong?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- I'll get in the back --
Thank you.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
No of course not.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Red Rum.
Mommy!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Oh,
No.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
How did he manage to do that?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
She eh... interferes.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
No, we don't mind.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Hi, babe.
Any ideas yet?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
He's still asleep.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Very nice to meet you.
Have any trouble finding us?
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
What time does the plane leave?
Went shopping. Why?
You booger.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
You all right, Marty?
Huh?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
What if I say no?
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
And I'm tearful!
How are you doing.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Oh my! 
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Shirelles.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Babies
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
A cigarette?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
Are you leaving us?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
St. Anne's?
The reason?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You're my Olympic event.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Vince knows you're here.
I can't go with you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
What're you doing?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Hey, girls.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Well?
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Sister Mary Patrick?
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
What the hell are you doing?
You must have missed your mark.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
He is a behemoth.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
The Widow Windsor.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Listen to what you say....
I manage fine alone.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Where are we going?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
We should not go much further in this murk.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What is it?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What books?
This is farewell.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Must I hear this?
It is only me.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Quickly, close it.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
Thank ye.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
You got that shit right.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
But maybe just for awhile --
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
They still around, your folks?
How do you know?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Maybe they needed it.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Well, I hate him.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
It was alive?
A boy or girl?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Yeah.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Do they know about you?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
What brings you back?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Okay.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Let's just go, Marsha.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Where will he go?
Will that be cash or charge?
And your father? Is he from New York?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
What happened?
What'll it be, Auggie?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
It's yours?
Hey, man, good to see you.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Two, right?
You usually get two.
Anything good?
Every word.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
There's just one thing I want to know.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Lovely.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
It's for you.
So I can get my job back.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I just want to know where he is.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
You going to sit here all day?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
And have you mended them?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Mostly what.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
Yeah, it might be.
Good thinking.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
Hi, kid.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Lettuce and tomato?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Closer to eight.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Robbed.  He was angry.
You said three minutes.
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
Can I say something, here?
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Are these your bags?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
No --- how does it go?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
DAPHNE?
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Men?
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
What happened?
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
What message?  What motorboat?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What happened?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
And your head is hot.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Yeah - Josephine.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
No!
What for?
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
We could pass for that.
Yes, I'm holding on.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Please.  It won't happen again.
You're leading again.
I don't care.
I forgive you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
And you'll be in all evening?
No, we couldn't!
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
Well, here we are.
We got time off for good behavior.
We understand.
Yeah.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Thank you.
How's the stock market?
Yeah.  Real hot.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Why?
Shell Oil?
Guess!
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
What's on Thursdays?
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
I don't want to bore you.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Well - ?
Good night.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Tomorrow night?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
What'll it be, sir?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Perfect. All ginny.
Christ, Amy.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
It was such a long time ago.
Does Kat know?
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
And Kat was fully clothed.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Hey, you!
You’re not even listening.
Hi. Hey.
Mmm.
Six thousand, right?
You quitting?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
It’s hard to explain.
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Hey, Sal.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
You pawned it.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
“Not yet...”
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
What is it you do again?
What do you say to that?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
That does it...
Well, how did you like the class, David?
And so you did your job, right?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
But, Charlie --
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You learnin' anything at that school?
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
You bet we is!
Mornin', son...
You feel alright today, Daddy?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Where did it come from, Mama?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
So when I left, she gave me these books.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Hello, David...
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
What did he want?
Well, let's get to work!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
What?
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
I can't believe he's dead.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
CARTMAN!
Mph rm rmph!!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Goodnight, honey.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Mom...
You've got a stupid accent too.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
The N word?
Hello there, children!!
Who are you, kid?
Purpre mama!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Oh my God...
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
This is sweet!!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Thank you, Kenny.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
And Bill?
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
We must take action on this immediately.
But I-
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
You'd fuck your uncle!
Hello, Conan!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
What did you do today Satan?
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
NAZIS!!
Wendy?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Getting drunk is no solution.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Jesus, come on!
Oh, thank you.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Were you going to give it to them?
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
What did you say to me?
All too well, captain.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Why, didn't they say?
You gotta think of your old age.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Is that clear?
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
We're going to die.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Really?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
He certainly is polite.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I'm in the bridge.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean?  What happened!
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
What is it?!
I'm fine.
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
I'm homesick.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
You a mini-golfer?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hey, you still here?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Sure, Sid.
- canker sore.
This scam we got going here was your 
It's a beautiful thing.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Theo.
What the fuck is this?
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
What about bowling?
He's the guy Buzz.
I don't like to talk about it.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did you do to Buzz?
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
Nice set-up.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
132, 154.
Yeah.
I'm a bowler.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Do you know where they're taking him?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
I can't tell you, Theo.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
How do you get this thing down?
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Who identified the body?
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
How big is this spacecraft?
There's heat coming the door.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Direction's east coming!
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Don't do it, Norman!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
What have you been told so far?
Anything else?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Then why am I here?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Harry's missing.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
I see it.
Yes, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
So how do we get it open?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
Some sort of lead or something.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
You're next, Norman.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Beth --
Don't do this.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Parasolutrine?
Not believing you.
The sphere looks different.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
You know what I mean.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Someone did.
You're lying --
That's when you went in the sphere.
I never went in that sphere.
Yes.
Shut up, Beth --
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Then where's it coming from?
Top shelf, is it?
You hear that?
Would it work?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
What are you looking for?
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
What?
When did it come across?
C'mon, Norman.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
You remember opening the door?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
You don't remember that?
Beth left?
Wisconsin's your answer.
That's right.
We're never gonna make it.
Missed.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Well, press something!
How's that working out, by the way?
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
What'd you say?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, he's polite.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
No, not anymore.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
Are you all right?
Are you sure you don't need it?
What is it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
Of course, where you been kid?
You're Starkiller?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I think she's going to be all right.
Is he afraid of the water?
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
No, this hurts.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Well, whad'ya know...
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm sorry, Carmen.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
She's flying starships !
Eeuch !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
You're late.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Do you mean it ?
What's wrong with you ?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Cover me.
What's that, Diz ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Best in the Fleet !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
How bad are you, pal ?
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Hit your jets, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The examination is a normal function.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
Captain, what's the next move?
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Forward motion, Captain...!
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
What should you have known?
Child...!?
Not for us?
Nope.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
But, but but but...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
...such a pleasant sound.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Uh huh.
You like kids?
Great.  Who is it...?
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You can do it.
That's right...
Yeah, you?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Drama Group?
And I might have something important to tell you...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Mornin', Doc...
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
What courthouse?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Waterford, Vermont.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You do...?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Get him on the phone.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
What...?
I know that...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...I know...I know...
An artist of your caliber...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
Hello.
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Kiss my ass.
Arrest him.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I...
What's in the case?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
What?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Town's out of lilacs.
I...
I...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
I...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
What's the...
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
I...
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Yeah?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
...not at all...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Zat true?
Why?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
I could help with the debate.
And what do you do wh...
You lost Ben?!
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
No.  I think it's ugly.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
No they're not.
...your hating me.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Rachel's job is she works.
Mommy?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
No.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
It's not good enough.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
That's necessary, huh?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Rachel's not half my age.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Our children.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
It's a huge moment in their life --
It's temporary.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I need practice.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
You feeling all right?
My boss.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Small world.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Looks nice enough to m...
And I'm going to win.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
You ride with Annabelle...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Not yet.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
She's not gonna die.
No problem.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
Where you goin'?
You heard me: leave the table!
Marty, ignore him.
Nice to have you here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Really? How many?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
No, you don't.
This is definitely better.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Twinkeys!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
It's all about who you know.
Sure!...
We did the same thing last year also.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hello, Vi.
I dunno...
So what's going on?
That's too bad.
Yeah. But not any more.
Great. How old are they?
OK. Bye.
You know...I like you.
You a pervert?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Let's move it we got company!
Forget about it.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
That's it!  Up ahead!
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Come on, drink up.
Good.
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
So, what are we looking at White?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Where the hell could they have gone!
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Possibly some coffee?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Yes?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Yes!
Go back to sleep, baby.
Does the threat board show anything?
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Why do you think I ask?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Suppose that were the case?
I suppose they are, sir.
How much soda, sir.
That about right?
What shall we drink to, sir?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Yes?
What's the target.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Then this is it.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
They must have made a visual contact.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Where'd they get you?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Second safety.
He's dead, all right.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
What do you mean?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Are you sure?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Sure, King.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
Can I have some?
Typical male.
Uh, home, you know.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Stuck with what guy?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
No, no.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I'd get bored.
A long, long, long...
You know what we should do? Go to the...
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Good.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Y- s-sure it did.
What?
Tim...
Yeah, man.
Come on man.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Buff.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
He paid you man.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
It's okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Whoa!
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You okay, man? You okay?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
I'd like to.
Deep down. Way down.
I know. It's okay.
Mm.
Um, mother-daughter.
Can you tell me what happened?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Tim, what are you talking about?
See ya later.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Well, w-what happened?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Jeff, stay there.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, I stand for -
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Oh, yeah?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Of course.
Come with me.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
No, I don't.
Mm-hm.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
To his hotel?
I've run out of words.
You did, huh? Good for you.
No, it's not...
Yeah.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Really?
Now?
Great.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look Pakeesa...
Pony, oh my god!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Is that your driver?
Oh!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah?
Your manager?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Fuck.
What?!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Hello?
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
Kansas!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Oh no...
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Really...
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
You sure you wanna go there?
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
They could kill you.
Your help.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
This is Miss Kramer.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
I've been hoping to run into you.
I had a teacher like that once.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
Who's Norma?
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
You bet.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Are you or aren't you?
I wrote that with my heart.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I want you to do this work.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Hold me tighter.
What's the matter with you?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Have one of mine.
Where are my cigarettes?
How did it go?
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
Whose room was this?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
What does it mean?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
A Storm Dragon?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Home?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Away. From you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Hi.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Before you go...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
She's right. They'll string her up.
A little.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I bet they do.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Guess! Go on.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Can I give you a lift?
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Superman will return it.
Where is Earth?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
She did that deliberately.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
What is this place?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You're going to take me back?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You're welcome...??
You know what's the problem?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Well, aren't you excited?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
A television set?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Man, what is this?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
What?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Yeah? How's it look?
You want to mess with Superman?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
There's no rush.
The picture looks blurry.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
Oh, Superman!
She's not his mama either.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Yes! This time we got it right!
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
Maybe I could try --
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
A "complimentary corsage."
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh Clark, no!
I want to.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
You do?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
Mush!  Mush!
Genius!  --  Lex.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
Why?
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
You must be freezing.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
What more?
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
You are master of all you survey.
General --- ?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
You're late. Very late.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
And what do we get out of it?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
What was that about?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
A hot story, huh?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Hey!
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It wasn't a trick!
What'd you call him?
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
You and your real estate.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Mr. Romance...
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Don't let me down.
You can't do this to me!
It's a ...baby.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Who...who...
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
How much do you weigh?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
I can help you.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
They just finished supper.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Because it's what we have to do.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Have you been waiting long?
What time's he coming home?
What are you thinking?
About the Ottos?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
What do you mean?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
You've talked to Billy?
You heard what Abbott said?
We've only got honey.
Is this mine?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
I don't want you to lie.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
That's the local bar?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Have they ever been busted?
Here we go.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
What for?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Some more wine?
Yes.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Yes.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Dolores?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
Why not?
What do you remember about the accident?
The door needs a lock.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Are you sleeping?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Will you mind your own business!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
He's somewhere...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Can I come out?  No.
Match me, Sidney...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Uh huh.
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
I thought he would.
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Avidly.  He was staring.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Back?
Don't you know who that man is?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
What would you think of me if -
Who else phoned?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
I can't
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Do you have bandages?
My God.
No good.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
What does that mean?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
We're better off by ourselves.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
They took him from me.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You broke my arm!
It's finally over.
Where do you stand on all this?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
What does he mean, too correct?
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I'm very sorry.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I guess so, sir.
Where you from, David?
What the hell are they doing?
Yes, David?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Think you can get me any of that?
I'm sorry.
Of course.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
How come?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Who?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
That's an outrageous lie!
I have illegitimate children.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Major.
Yes, you remember.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
You were in insurance before the war.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Can you handle it?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
You cold?
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
You'll learn.
Bag some Z's?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Not possible.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I don't think I like this.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Same shit.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Admittedly...
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Clean out your locker.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
Oh, God... !
Alright... okay...
You've got to be kidding.
I'm sorry, about this...
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
This is C.R.S.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Goodnight.
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
They're watching.
No!  I'm sick of this...
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
What the fuck are you... ?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Don't move, you bitch... !
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
About me?
Really?
Will you?
It doesn't matter...
How do you mean, exactly?
Slow down, take a breath...
What have they been doing to you?
It's them.  They did this.
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
Yes.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
Oh... it's a game.
How long will these take?
You don't need me...
Where?
Guess!
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Hm?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
What's this about?
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
I don't like her.
What gentleman, Maria?
What the fuck... ?!
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Yeah.
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
What did it smell like?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
It was a stupid thing to do.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
What happened?
When do we take the tests?
She needs help.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
No.
Good night, Theo.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Is it over?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Nell, what happened?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Italian?
I like the colors.
What's the matter?
No.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
You think I'm staying?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Who done it, then?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Has he?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Why did you come here?
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
-- Your employer?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Fancy it?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
So what's your beef, pal?
Of the deal, man.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Where is he now?
Don't you work with Ian?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah, that's right.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
How much.
Hey.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
There is?
What?
You do?
Like what.
He's expecting you?
So why would he want to see you.
You've made it ... brighter.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Pleasure.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
...Yes?
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
...You don't like the music out there?
Yeah.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
...I stank, didn't I?
...I wanted to make you happy.
...Mm.
...she can go up there.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No problem!
...You bring a check?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
All right.
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
How much to they want, Dave?
...Oh, Jesus.
...Dave?
Rye.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
How did you get into the store?
Yeah.
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
No thanks.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Coffee, Ed?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
I don't work here. My wife does.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...I'm Crane.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Forget it!
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Lieutenant --
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What does it say?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Dr. Frock?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
I don't want to go this way.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Shut them up!
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
What?
That's impossible.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
What happened?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Wounded?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
That was D'Agosta.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Welcome.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
What's he doing?
Sure she would.
No...I, er.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
What exactly?
No.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
Oh, God.
Every time you and Marlon--
What did you want?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
Arrah!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
What do you do?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
I need your clothes, Byers.
Special Agent Scully --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Do they know?
You looking for him for some other reason?
Do I know you?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
-- You saw this experiment?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Mulder...?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Now what?
Had you.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
Something's not right...
You're... quitting?
I wake you?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Why are you whispering?
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
What? What's wrong?
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
We're going to the morgue.
Well, call General McAddie.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
You're lying.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Don't bring it home in this.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Agent Novak?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
He's mine?
You liked him?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Nervous?
So?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Right here.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
What's she talking about?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
H-E-Z-T...
Tell me about him.
...to steal my girl.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
He liked to laugh.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...again.
...is there?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
That's his headache.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
That's what we want to find out.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
Been here long?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
...expense.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Miss Schmidt.
A parrot bit me.
So would I.
...in the morning.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Calloway!
Win what?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Very good, sir.
Shall I go over there, sir?
...excuse me.
Do you know his number?
You do!
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What's that?
Zane Grey.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hello, Harry.
I want to talk to you.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
You told them, didn't you?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
...were of you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Martins.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Something wrong.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Richard - I saw a fin!
Big?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
He tried to borrow money from us.
But he has been there, off course.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
So from there to there?
Have you told someone?
Francoise -
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
We lost our key.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Watch your language....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They only kill them when they love them?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
How come you know all this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
You will.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Your father??
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
What's it about?
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
That's a much easier game.
More cultural than political.
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
And? WHat did you notice?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Those aren't Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Think about your father. Your sister.
Don't tell me what I --
What part of Germany are you people from?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Tell it to Hitler.
Hello...?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
That's all we've got left.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
When do you want it to go off?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Are you an artist?
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Oh, fuck you...
Johana, am I boring you?
It can't be true!
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Where did you two meet?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
Well, good night, then...
Jacques!  Johana!
Why?
Ten thousand.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
It isn't lit yet.
And where did you say you were from?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
That's good.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
No, no!
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
What?
He doesn't like us.
Don't you have a heater?
Please, have a seat.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Hello?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
I'm being a pain, huh?
You sure?
Jacques...?
You want to lie down for a while?
Uncle Louis!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What are they for?
Who... Who is that?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Will he understand Spanish?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Want to get a drink?
What!?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
So don't show a picture.
How do we bypass it?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Get off of me you cripple!
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Sure!
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
The death card - -
He will be waiting...
What, senorita?
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Some crazy guy.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tell me.
Why did you give up teaching?
That was unfortunate.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
That's a fact, isn't it?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
Who is he?
——	As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Can it be that easy?
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Are we understood?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Mr Lombard...
When did you get back?
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
How... When did you...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
By your Austrian?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
We’ve still got the Italian...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Why?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Where?
Where are we?
Where are the kids?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Piss off!
Carlos De Moraes?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Must I speak to you in French?
I take it your son is called Leon?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Am I supposed to know him?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
At what time will you be available?
What is it?
Your lady friend did.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Evening. Table for one?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
What’s the date?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Alors?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Three...
You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
So why didn’t he?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
I would like some fresh straw.
What did they say?
Good.
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
What did the king say?
I'm already free...
Go onto the next question.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
W-w-what are you doing?!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Really?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
The English??
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Were you baptized?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Get them out of here!
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Supposing she's an assassin?
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Good.  Where are the English?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
You don't believe me anymore?
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
How many did he give you?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I... I never lied!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
God asked you to do something?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
What signs?
Yes...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
My father's.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
A beauty. Who is she?
I'm going to get a doctor.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
I need help.
When's your baby due?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Can you help us?
I've no money.
We're recruiting.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
That's better than yesterday.
What did you pay him?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Pig!
Dirty pig!
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What the hell are you doing?
I don't know how to thank you.
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
T-w~e-l-v~e.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
You don't want to learn.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
She wants to see what you can do.
What's in here then, lead?
All right if I look around your lobby?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
You got a bag or somethin?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
How much did ya lose?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
We cleared 22 here.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
There's always a depression on.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
They're still looking for him.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Lonnegan after you, too?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
No signs of trouble?
And?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Henry.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Raise 500.
I guess I left it in my room.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Who are you?
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I don't even know you.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
So could Shaw.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
You want a drink or something?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Cheer up, darling.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
What?
Oh, Andy.
I can't.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
You hand that over to the police.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Another Martini --
Shrapnel!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That woman!
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
I never saw him before.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
What about Jorgensen?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Shut up.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
About three.
I didn't know they had a fight.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
But he's interested!
Do you think that Wynant did it?
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
Where were you?
I know.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
That's my business.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Well, let me do that for you.
But what if you need more money?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Perfectly absurd.
So it's you he was after!
You got types?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
But it's Christmas now.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
You're a fine watch dog.
Who gave it to you?
Aren't you hot in that?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
He's just been for a walk.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Back to California
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What are you going to do?
You're going to drive me crazy!
I hope you're well.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Well, congratulations.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Turn the car around.
He's not so--
What kind of mine?
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Get off him.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
So you can give us away?
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Steady it out!
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Where you going?
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
They're doing more than slapping.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
A whole lot of nothing.
Wait.
No.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
And then shoot them.
...Wes...?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Australia.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
You really think there's a treasure inside?
That's in two days.
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
At-at-at-at-at.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
I think he wants something to drink.
Stress category.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
I'm not hungry.
I haven't done anything.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
They're watching us now.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
I thought you were through with it!
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
What was that....
You don't know that!
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
They're not here.
And you are...?
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Alright, let's check it out.
Now wait just a fucking-
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
So cut both.
It's working.
Ex-girlfriend?
How do you know?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Fuck factor?
Good, now the other side.
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Political.
C4, plastic explosive.
You okay?
Why are we stopping here?
I want to work this.
What the hell was that?
Prints?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Oh shit...
Next week we work the park.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Reilly, Vice. I-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
Yes!
Good morning, Major.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
I would start with cocktails.
And as for you, waiter--
I don't want to see you at all!
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
The tennis player?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Thank you!
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
And you--
Then you go into the foyer.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Naturally I did.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
It's disgraceful!
The same thing.
Good night. 
No--yours, madame.
Like that!
But attractive--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Thirty-three--
Yes, Gaston?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
But you're the more intelligent one.
No--I'm sorry.
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Holy shit.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You're a good liar.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You know somebody?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
How cold?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
HELP! HELP!!
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
What's this?
And...?
A whole ten cents?!
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
It's bad.
This is horseshit.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
You have to go for help.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's getting quiet.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Anya!
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Oh--a hundred times--
I hope so.
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
No-o!
You've got lipstick all over you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
This is Mr.--er--
Married?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
What are you thinking?
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
What, again?
What?--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Well, I'll be--!!!
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
My change.
Inspector McKinney.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Hello, young fellow!
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
That's too bad.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
That's me!
McKinney's the name.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Am I a member of this club?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Yes.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Get that out of your trunk.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Can you read 'em Jack?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
I went for four.
I wish I could.
Not because of Ned.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
No!
Congratulations.
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
There you are, sir.
He's certainly good-natured.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
He said to turn loose of him.
Shut up, Ike.
I want them spitting blood!
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Come on, you...
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Forget it.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
On three?  You call it.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
What is it?
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
I hate Sadie.
Always?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
How you doin', boy?
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
What about all these saloons?
But -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Yes -
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
She married a hockey player.
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
... Kids?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Have we met?
Boyfriend?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
I hope you'll be gentle.
Blood or Dutch?
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
Sometimes you just have to -
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Sleep well?
And number two?
And when might that be?
... What's Harmsway done?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
What is HE doing here?
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
Please sir. Please -
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
What did your wife get her?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
I'll drive her to the hospital.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
It was nip and tuck.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
What is that?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Not anymore, not in the city.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're always taking his side.
What, are you having another party?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Harry, you know everything.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
How many people do you all feed?
Some people grow up and change their ways.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
How are you?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Yeah?!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Hey!  Wow!
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
I could have stopped him.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Hey, watch it!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
I'm red this time.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
You'll put your clothes here.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
How long has -
You're well built; how old are you?
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
I... I don't really know.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's not here.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
So my wife is lying?
This is different.
How long have you known?
My Leica's gone.
Are you going to?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
I don't know.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
...How old are you?
Yes, mom --
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Arizona.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
You first.
You will help me with my other problem.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
A group of us are going out tonight.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Somewhere safe.
What's your name?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I'm sorry.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Great.
Diane.
Sorry.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Following the game at all?
You take the test?
Have you got any gear on you?
Now remember --
Exactly.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
You don't know, do you?
The park?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
You know.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
That's hardly a substitute.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
There.
How long is it?
With a starship!
It could. Yes.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Following new course. Warp seven.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Your pain runs deep.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
And that is?
Ah, Captain?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Yes, Captain.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Spock.
Spock... don't.

Borgus Frat.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I know you better than that.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Did you say Group 7 access?
Did he say why?
Beautiful!
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
That all you can say?
Oh. Anything else?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
You said it.
Flynn?
Well I want to communicate --
What, just the three of us?
Flynn!!
Hey... you guys OK?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Yes, MCP.
A User?
New guy...
You've grown, big program.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
Nice...
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
Helen's going to be pissed.
Copy that.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Give me the page.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Now what?
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Yes.
I'm late.
Uh huh.  Okay.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
What?
Yes.
My husband can't know about this.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
What did he give you?
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No.  But I wanted to.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
You working on someone right now?
Boris and Doris?
What's going on, Harry?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
That was you?!
And you chased one?
What is it you want me to do?
To our assignment.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Who is this woman?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him we gotta go.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Turn-offs?
That's a long time.
God, Spiderman looks different.
So he really loved her?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
That dazzling imagination.
Is he black?
Is he nice?
What did he do to Arlene?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I do.
Where you goin', honey?
I think what you did...
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
I'm hip.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
Naw naw!
Live with what?
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Clarence?
It's great to hear from you.
I'm a married man.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot what?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
Do you really mean it?
No. But thanks.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Where'd he come from?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Or a bit player -
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
What was the Jew-boy's name?
Wake up, Cole.
Women will want to get to know you...
To be determined by the proper authorities.
That's him.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Do you know what year it is?
"Never cry wolf!"
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
They're keeping an eye on me.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
You smell so good.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Why are we doing this?
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Excuse me -- what did you say?
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Uh, that message...me?
What...virus?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Nine thirty
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
You afraid of the dark?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
It's nonsense.
How much time?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Nothing.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
No!
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What's the matter?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Do you have to call me that?
Wasn't nothing.
Thank you, John.
Least you can leave.
Where you coming from?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
You love him?
Is it pretty?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
Let's do it here.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
I shot him.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I have half a mind to--
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Hey!
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
You meant it.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
I came to kill her.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
What are you babbling about?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Two-hundred dollars.
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
You're fucked.
Mister!
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Kids.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Got any cold soda?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Mister!
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You meant it.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
But you was going to fight for me.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will he be back soon?
But he's dead.
Twenty-after-ten.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
That's right on my way.
Thank you, Bobby.
Where you coming from?
A medicine man?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Is that why you're with him?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I can't see it.
I don't know about that?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
I busted my leg!
Where ya goin'?
"Arkady"
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Out of here.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
One way, or round trip?
Heineken?
Morning Grace.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Who was that on the phone?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Proceed.
Wrap it up.
How old is Jeb?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
Okay.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Oh shit...
I've come to a decision.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
I'm not sure.
What about the game?
You've never been sick?
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's doing well today.
Yeah?
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I'm going to work out.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
I'm not scared.
I know now.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You like sports?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
How are you feeling?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Was your family traveling with you?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Well, go get it then.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He give 'em names?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Yeah, I guess.
Books. He's my biographer.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Uh... a little, maybe.
Hit your finger, huh?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
But... if he doesn't miss?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Who killed him?
Then... what?
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
She's passed on, Kid.
You're goin' back with him?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Shit!
He ain't killed.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Yup.
Yeah, I guess so.
I trust you, Bill.
You... gonna take... the money?
He musta been movin' right along.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
HEY.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Three.
That fella come by... Tom.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Did you... did you... ?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
More.
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
We done that stuff.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They want more time to think about investing.
I know who he is.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
No killing?
How are you, Keaton?
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
What do you mean I can't see him?
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
So this lawyer...
You're stalling, Verbal.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
He was accused of jury tampering.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
We thought it was just.
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
We went to Code Blue...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
Ed Concannon.
What book is that?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
You would not...?
I do.  Yes.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am seventy-four years old.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
I read the hospital report on your client.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
I object, your Honor...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Pardon?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
D'you find an apartment?
I'm a lawyer.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Hi, Mickey ...
... now who is that ...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
Admittance form is wrong.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
What happened, Joey...?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What are you doing in New York...?
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
Dr. Towler...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
He won't talk.
You don't have to do it for a living.
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Would you like a drink now?
No.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Will you, Judy?
I don't like it!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Where shall we go for dinner?
Scottie, why are we here?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Yes!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
What are you going to do?
You don't remember.
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How old?
Why?
Do you hear anything?
Would you like a drink of water?
Have you been here before?
No, I can't tell you!
What do you remember?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
Madeleine --
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
I had to quit, Midge.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
How's your love life, Midge?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Step number two.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Mm. Better.
What I've been doing?
How ya doing?
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Why?
This is pathetic.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
More.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What do you think you are doing?
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
How do you figure?
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
We'll be ready Adam.
Are you solid with that?
If anything ever happens to me...
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
Have you thought about what I said?
My god.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
What is it?
Who?
Is everything okay?
But not tonight.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
You said that Boyd.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
We need padded chairs.
What kind of words?
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Boyd...What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
My what?
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
What do you mean, you think so?
Caterer?
Why did you forget the tent check?
Don't you dare.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Well you should.
What's the word on the chairs?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
No way.
What?
What are you talking about?
You killed a prostitute.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
He kept saying he was protected.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
It means she's insecure.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
That ought to be about the end of that.
I have no idea.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Pup corn?
Yeah?
That's a good one.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Good times.
Right.
Give them to Refugio.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
Was that difficult to get?
Come down here, you scamp.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
You must think I am a monster.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
What will the lady say?
Is it all right?
That's fifteen by seven?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
She's mad.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
How in hell does it wind up?
You see how much you like her?
Kill him.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
What do you know about me?
Are they going to work here too?
Yes. Why?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Yes -- very, very big!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Ask the priest, miss.
What happened to me?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
You all right?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Think you can do it?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
What happened when he was 17?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Give me your wrist.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
What does that mean?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't get out of the car.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Can I ask you something?
More or less.
My guess is dead.
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
...tonight...
It's the White House.

Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Why do people go to war?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Dartmouth
Trade Re1ations.
Do I know you?
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Who?
"The Country Is At War." 
What do we have that they want?
We don't need an Act Two.

Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Grand Marnier.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
...thanks Natalie.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
What was that?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Yeah, right...
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I guess I'll head back...
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello Bud.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
How you doing Buddy?
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
He still likes you
Businessman?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
And uh, your nicotine sir
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Then why do you still like her?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Anyone else not coming?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Stop saying things so loud!
Do you have a scarf?
Of course you will.
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Fireball?
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Are you humoring me?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
What?
That can't feel good.
How're you holding up?
I'm sorry?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Well maybe your wife...
When...when will she be back?
I've seen you.  From the window.
I wanted to apologize.
No, I don't.
Why are you here?
She got it.  Turned it down.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Absolutely.
Telling you...
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Okay.  Okay.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I can't believe this is happening.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Jody he was lying.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Maybe we should just...
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Remember how we were?
Oh.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
He killed her.
It's a flare.
See?
I didn't do that.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
This is the Feur thing?
Keep your voice down.
You know I am.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
...I'm positive this time...
I don't like this, this...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
She did it.
The leaves...
Adamant.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Don't tell Rowan about this.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
I beg your par---
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Lasher - bring us through!
uh - then he - be just -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
A girl...?
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
What is wrong...?
I do not understand...
No!
Oh god...
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
What do you see...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Harder...
you're very --- different.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Seems more like a year than a month.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
You did that, didn't you...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
It doesn't mention 'females only'
So what do you do?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What is it?
We've got nothing to talk about
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Well, what do you think?
What?
Dr STECKLER?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
See? Did you see that?
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
So far away? In Xenia?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Never say never.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
You go first.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
The lesson being?
You guys are my parents.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Ted! Do something!
Well?
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
If you could just sign right there.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Me?
Don't write that part.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Well? What do you think of her?
Wow...you clean up nice.
I see.
That's probably my office.
He's on the move?
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
Tell me more.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You were the new and improved you.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
What are you doing?
In a hurry, are we?
My parents? What do you mean?
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Merritt, Forensics.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
How long?
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Eliminate the competition.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Where's the body?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Why?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
She bit you?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
A ride.  You want one?
I say something funny?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Excuse me?
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Say you love me.
I'm running away.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Who is it?
It doesn't look like it.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
What?
What's wrong?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Didn't you see her this morning?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Aha!
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
You feeling all right?
All that jumping and kicking.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
No record of him.
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Good work.  Really.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
You're not that big.
Easy now.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Now it's a bomb.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Why did you say that?
Sorsha.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Dada, what's a daikini?
You must learn magic.
Oooh, this smells terrible.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
I'm not going in there.
Get back here, Rool!
She needs to be changed.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
This is not going well.
Milking?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Your hole is healed, then?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
So one of them got to him.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
It's all over, Paul.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why would they murder...
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
But why?
Enjoying your reading?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
When will you be going?
You're so sure of that?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Everything okay?
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
Is this where we're going?
I don't want to stay here.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Toto's my dog.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, now?
Oh --
...bed.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
And him a brain.
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
...don't talk.
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Yes -- there --
Oh -- Oh --
...ting the ruby slippers?
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Here --   Come on.
Stop pushing!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
You don't get around us that easy!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
...junk!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
Yeah --
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
-- Ruined my exit!
You new?
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
Who’s she?
Nuclear.
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
We’ve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
It’s just a scratch.
Construction’s not exactly my line.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
The name?
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
She’ll get over it.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
I met you at my father’s funeral.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
I’m coming with you.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
The Maiden’s Tower.
What?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Warm.
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
What's your theory?
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
Jon --
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Old?
. . . What?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
. . . That was quick.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Where's Laurie?
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What happened?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
New information.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
What do I get out of it?
Is that all?
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
How will you fix it?
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, you're good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
Are you alright?
Aren't you afraid?
Where's he headed?
You okay?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
What are you doing?
The Peace conference...
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
This is your standard dart gun.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
What's this?
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wish I could go.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Are you all right?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Jean... can you?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
You should always work with a spotter.
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Dr. Grey.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What am I doing here?
He helped you?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
What did she do to me?
I felt like she almost killed me.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
What was your grandfather's name?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Yes, sir.
MMMmm!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Darling!
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
I hope you like large weddings.
Does that mean you love me?
Darling!
Darling!?!
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Good night.
You mean... the laboratory??
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Vermicelli.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But, sir...
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
There.
There wolf!  There castle!
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music??
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
How?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Throw the second switch!
More, do you hear me?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Yes.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Where is he?
What monster?
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Inga!
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
I'd be so nervous.
All right -- give it to him!
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
How long is it so far?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
