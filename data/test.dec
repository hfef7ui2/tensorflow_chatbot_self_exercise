Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I was?
What crap?
What good stuff?
Let's go.
Is he oily or dry?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
What do you think?
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
As in...
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
And where're you going?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
He seems like he thrives on danger
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
That's what I just said
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She kissed me.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Away.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Forget it.
We don't chat.
I didn't have a choice.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
I'm gettin' there
What are you doing here?
Look up, sunshine
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Something like that
For. . . ?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Enough!
So what I want doesn't matter?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
When I go?
Yeah.  I guess.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Yeah.
With the teeth of your zipper?
What's to discuss?
See you next week!
Tumescent!
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
The Judgment is ours!
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Thank God...
You don't usually ask.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Chief says -- he has a God.
Passion is something one cannot control!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I knew you would.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesn't work.
And what do you think Mendez?
Come over here.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You think I don't know that?
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
They're not gonna send you right back.
Right.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
It was my decision, not his.
Who do you think, Chief?!
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
But Chief?  Over this??
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Stay with her.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
You're Polish?
Stay here.
You got any better ideas?
I'll call it... tails.
My point exactly.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
That's good.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
No.  Are you proposing?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You'll be my first.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Yes.  Both.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
You said speak Czech!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Sit down!
Cut!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
No, I don't get that!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
A job?
As a plumber?!
What are you doing here?
You want the tape?  There it is!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
I want to hear everything he said.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I used an accelerant.
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
He knew all along.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Okay, come on down.
Sure, what is it?
Yes?
It's possible.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
No.
He's got a point.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
And don't you worry about it.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Yeah, I've been busy.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I didn't have the time.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Shit.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I guess he got the message...
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Jack?  What was that?
Hi, it's me...
Hiya, kid.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
That's what I always say.
How would you know?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
Corn-i-Lius?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
No thank you.
They are robots!
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
So you do know her.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
What kind of mission?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Don't exist bud.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
...'Scuse me?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Yes ma..
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Found it?
Does it get any better or what!
He's on vacation.
Not without Leeloo.
I've had enough good news for today
Why not?
I thought you were divorced.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Apipoussan!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Exactly.
Because...
Been here long?
Actually only one cell survived..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Do you know how much I missed you?
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
I love you.
I know.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
... What's going on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
I promised him to Machine.
What can I do for you today?
Hmm.
Is it?
I'd rather you didn't.
Right here.
Where are the women?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
We do.
I'm not so sure about this.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Something like that.
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Why?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
They're no friends of mine.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
I'm asking.
Pardon me?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Child pornography.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Thank you.
My condolences.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
No.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Will you let me look?
No...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
What?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
We have matching luggage.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
"In her dream"?
Extra money, huh?
Is there something we can do?
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Earth to Alice...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Let me talk to you.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Don't worry, honey
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
It's lonely in there, in my room.
No...
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
To take a picture.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Sobering...
I've got to go.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
But I've seen her grave.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
All of us.  Right?
He invited me to his house last night.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Yes?
A lot of people think like that.
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Yes, Griff?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Come where?
- for horrors like yourself?
Thank you.
All right - go to it.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Twombley involved?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
How soon?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yeah.
Oh.
Hmm.
Yeah.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right!
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
It's not that.
It's stupid.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
It belongs to Pop.
No.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
What are you sorry for?
I know.
Fuck you.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I'm fine, fine.
Could be.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Yeah.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Said what?
Tonight. Let's get together.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
But not now.
You knew me as a kid.
What way?
Good.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
How?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
When did she die?
How's that?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
This town sucks.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
You think Jack shot him?
What happened?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
What about her?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Not particularly.
For what?
Your father never means to be so...
Yes dear?
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Hey, you guys back already?
Been better, Dad... You?
Did we warn them off?
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Got it.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Lemme take a look.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
I prefered the terrorists.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Because it is my duty.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Tower, here.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Hold on, Alice.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
We're under attack.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
This is the President.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I might still have a few chips left.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
You better check it, Unger.
Te...!
Who's that, Ted?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
That was very well put, Ted.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Set!
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Negative.
Negative.
Go ahead.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Yeah.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
What should I say?
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Then Elaine was right.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Surely there must be something you can do.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
That's right.
Well...
I love you, Elaine.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Uh-huh.
You promise you'll write.
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Thank you.
Yeah...
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Yes...
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
How the hell do you know that?
But I-- .
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
This is mole.  It's good.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
You are married?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
... It's Harcourt.
We can't let him get away.
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Who else can I ask around here?
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Sure.  Just a minute.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
She's right.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Bullshit!
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
...We're coming in.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Aye-firmative.
Let's get these things lit.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
On my way.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Did you ever have a baby?
You mean dead.
Look!
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Yes.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
You might be disappointed.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Sir -
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I want to go back to Vienna.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Em iram! Em iram!
Well, don't do that again!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Oh, damn!
Why not? Half the house!
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
You'd think I was mad.
Madame. How can I help you?
Yes.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
But! I'm a married woman!
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Money! Money!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Be careful!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
Michael!
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
Ah-ha!
Yes?
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Well. There it is.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
How is your financial situation?
This is just a game, Papa.
I will, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes what?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Animals?
German!
Wolfi!
What is this?
Why not?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Really?
Ah!
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
But this is absurd!
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
What exactly are you working on?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
What work?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
This is only a vaudeville.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
I'm too young to be so sick.
Finish what?
Yes.
Please! Just one moment.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
You go fast!
Yes.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Exactly.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Did you try?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
What difference does that make?
I can't wait.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
What happened to them?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
What?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Right.
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
Twenty-eight.
Not just a patient -- me.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Okay.
Will you shut up!?!!
No.
No.
No.
No.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Has he been refusing food?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
No, but we're about to.
You could have told them!
Where am I?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Nice to see you.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Yeah?
Pecos Bill.
Are you going to help me up?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What?!
Nurse!
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
What do you think?
How shall I do it?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
You here again? What do you want?
Yeah.
Aw, nerts!
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
What about?
What do you mean, help?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
My apartment.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Got a handkerchief?
Hello, darling.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Why, I don't know.
Yes, sir.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
Mine too?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
All right.
Oh, is that so?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Mr. Williams . . .
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
wasn't anywhere near this place—
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Then where were you?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
How?
Leave me alone, Bob.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
Oh no...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
What's going on?
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
It was exciting.
So what do we do, General Lee?
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Yep.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
I'm out.
Missed you too, cousin.
Sadie was not a man!
Get buckets!
Ho-yah!
Me get heap firewater --
My little Web did that?
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
I think he's already feeling better.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
So we got a plan?
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Ma.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Oh yeah.
No, I --
Yeah, Jimmy?
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Yeah Jimmy?
A fair number, Ma.
Mmmm.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
What?
Where will you find such a girl?
Sparkling rocks?
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I figured.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I think so.
You do that.
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
THEN WHO DID?!
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I can't believe this.
Vengeance.
Eight?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
I'm ignoring you.
What do you want, Courtney?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Yes, Courtney?
Do...what.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
Good coloring.
There was no ad in the Times.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Uh huh.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
When?
Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
No, not really.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Sorry. 
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Why would I?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
No, I'm okay.
Shoot.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
I know. I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
We were both seven in 1969.
Oh.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
That's not the information I've received.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Marcus?
But Marcus denied it?
I checked it out. It's clean.
So who was he with?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
I'm not...
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
I've been great. And you?
Yeah, well, you're late.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
'Gonna wait outside.
I can paint anywhere.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Milo! What about --?
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
You can't just walk in, either.
What?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
You're just afraid to eat it.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He wasn't acting?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
What'd they ever do for you?
Gimme the coordinates?
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
...Do I?
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
The wrong place?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Why's that?
She saved my life.
But why would they --?
No, no. Never.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Gary.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
It's three years old, it --
Let's try #2.
I met this girl.
I didn't plan this.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Hey, how are you?
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes?
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Yes, Basil?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Why?
Let me see.
How do you know?
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Lay it on me.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Where did you learn to shoot?
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Not me.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Show me.
He's asleep.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Why?
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Black...
Love...
... love ...
So I'm still ...
Have we met?
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
We want to help...!
Thank you, Steed.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
I'm already married ...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
What are my choices?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
1922. Why the kippers?
Whereas you are.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
For a man in my position --
Small talk.  Try the weather.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
You mean my other self ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Orders.
I thought you didn't.
You don't trust me?
You lied.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Still a bit chilly ...
You're saying I have no choice.
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Peter's brother?  But --
We want Mrs. Peel.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
She may try to kill you.
Anyone particular in mind?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
She was ...
Both, actually.
Walk over to the window ...
Perish the thought.
You wish.
If you say so.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Bond... James Bond.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The car for Debbie?
So does Debbie.
Yes I did.
Yes, sir, I am.
But how can I do that?
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
It looks awful.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
C'mere.
Good...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Yes...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Quiet, Mother.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
I think I screwed that one once.
Any time, Al.
Let's see your bread.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
You're a pimp?
I want women.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's Bullwinkle.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Of course.
Olivier's in that, right?
C'mon. I insist.
Oooooo.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
We're gonna be okay, man...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
He's alive.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Roll the hose.
Just leave me alone, okay?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Jennifer.
You look great.
Really? No kidding.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Well, you did invite me here.
Leave Stephen out of this --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Just take it.
Then who --
Trychticholorate.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Pest control.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Backdraft.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
What's wrong?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Absolutely.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
I need that report, Lt.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Who?
Who?
You mean you could use it.
I'm a Catholic.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
All right, cop. I want my money.
Let me think about it.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What money?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Yes, Sister?
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Did he gots to be.
Ho!
YEAH!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Must be the pressure.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Manray needs a job.
And this is Manray.
Well do something about it.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
No costume.  No blackface.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Go on.  Good so far.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
What are there character traits?
Exactly!
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
Calm down, please.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Hello.
Which one is your brother?
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Light?
That's why it will be so much fun.
Yeah.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
He said that?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Soon.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
...too early...
You slept too near where you got in?
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Y'know what?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Say what, Manray?
You can go now.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
And so I am.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
It must have been some other gate.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Have you had one?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
What is to be done?
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Yes, of course.
Yes, papa.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
And he doesn't care about me?
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
What do we do?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
We found him like this --
It's... too slow.
I'm not telling you what happened.
But not Pike's.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Your weapons, Sergeant.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Do I?
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
I didn't do anything --
Because I was standing next to him.
Well, he's a good soldier.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
That's preposterous --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
I lost a bet.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
I lied. Wait for it...
Watch me.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
That bugs you too?
You couldn't have known --
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
I should probably write that down.
What are you talking about?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
What?
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
The fuck are you talking about --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Not yet.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
No.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
No, I understand.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Oh, so you know.
How what happens?
Like this.
Go out with me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Because he's dying.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Yes.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Yes?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
What for?
No I don't.
There's over eighty thousand here.
We'll stop then.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Right.
What are you doing here?
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Have you got your passport?
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You...
You don't understand you either.
Not really. Maybe a little.
She's dead.
I'm trying to quit.
No. I think I better just go.
It's not mine either.
Right.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Yes, ma'am.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You take her to a doctor?
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
At church?
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
I need ya help again.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
Now wait...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Yeah.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
You sayin' you'll do what?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
No ma'am.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Uh-uh.
I can handle that.
Sure.
No joke.
I ain't in a hurry.
Anything.
I'm here with you.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I tried.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Huh?
Now, hold up.
Naw!
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Yes'sir.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Yeah, I do.
Got in a little accident.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Let go...
Charlie...
-- I should tear your head off.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
You said that in the last two places.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What does Charlie mean?
I wasn't expecting you.
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
I don't, that's all.
Yeah...
I can see that.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
Gaiijin.
I want to yank Kobo.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Yes...
We can't lose.
He gets as much as he wants.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
He drinks.
Who am I supposed to be?
Tell them I'm not.
Save it, I already took the tour.
This by this...
Why?
What...?  What if I say no?
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
If he won't cooperate?
Where?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Why?
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Well, actually
You're just all so... so different.
Like what?
Of course not.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
You didn't like her!?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Soon as I finish the job.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Do you have something against science?
Ya.
No thanks.
Sorry.
Too old.
Me too.
Yes?
Of course.
What did she want?
What night?
What's suck night?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
For holes.
I bet I would.
And who do I go to about you?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Of course not.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
You did?
If they are smart, they take naps.
What?
Hmmm?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I never felt better.
If she is, the machine works.
What one?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I don't have one.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's your problem?
Is that why you're still here?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Do ya?
You're lost?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Oh, that's nice.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Oh, I could die...
I haven't brushed yet.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
My Mom and Dad.
Sorry.
Why?!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Everybody's divorced.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
Sorry!
You said it would be easy!
Thank-Q!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Sure.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah.
Okay!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
And don't be so obvious!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Goodnight!
Yes, Eve?
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
What?
Tempus fugit!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
No, son. A pitcher.
No. Sit down.
Shit is a French word?
Yes, father?! Yes?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Uh, I think they have.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You nut!
1959.
Russia.
I'm not wearing his pants.
I just don't want to.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Just look!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Well, we're here to help!
I'll go up.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
To you maybe.
Then after that it's safe.
I'm not hungry.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
What?
Coming!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Mutants?!
Excuse me.
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
I thought ten years.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Oh, yes.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I think...it...works.
No.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
Those sluts!
To bed.
Yes, you do!
Coward!
Give it back to him.
Have him committed.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Then what?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
The criminals are winning.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
No, not at all.
Jeffrey.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Never before this.
I, I don't know.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Don? Are you in with them?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
I sure don't hate you.
What do you want?
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I did. Are you?
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Who, Dorothy?
Don? Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Oh he forced you, huh?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
My bourbon.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
What?
Nothing.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Alright.
Yeah. okay.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hey Jeff.
Uh-uh.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Where are they?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Okay, okay. Bye.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Frank!!!
No.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
You can change it if you want to.
Go find one.
Aye.
What?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Where's your gun?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
What happened?
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
I-I'll tip her.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
We paid attention in school.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
He got beat up by a girl.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
For what?
A bit.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
And he is one smart man.
He's a good man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Rule of thumb?
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Where's my cat?
You killed my... my...
Pee...Per...Man.
It was... It was...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The fat man.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Twist of lemon!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Who were the victims?
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey Murph.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well, I'm sold.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Y-Yes my son.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You feel?
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
God have mercy on my soul.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
No. This is he.
Would they do that?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I saw it.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That sets it off.
Yeah, I heard that.
You think we're going to be chased?
We got it. We got it.
Don't even say it, man.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I'll say it.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No kidding.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Don't panic, Anthony.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
That's not correct.
I know.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Who's Mr. Henry?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Right now.
Bob!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm sorry, Bob.
As a person?
Yes. I do.
Roger.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
So do I.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Hold it.
Take a deep breath.
Yes, he did.
Me?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Why'd you want to help us?
Let them fight.
See you, Bob.
What was that?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Sure.
Who's got the car keys?
That's your friend Anthony?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
That never would of --
What are you talking about, Bob?
You're paranoid, Bob.
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, Dignan.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Let's just go.
God DAMMIT.
He electrocuted someone?
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Don't count it.
I told you they were there.
It's registered in my mother's name.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
I can't do that, Bob.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
What's his name?
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Let's go.
Anthony. Bad news.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
That's OK.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Where's Applejack?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
I'm trying.
He said what?
We're just going over a few things.
Sure.
Mr. Henry?
Good to know you, John.
What do you mean?
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Don't know.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
The sooner the better.
What do you have, Danny?
And?
Jesus...
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Is this really happening?
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I don't know who that is.
-- take the back -- get another car --
I worry when you get like this.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
We can't wait to be sure.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
No. You never worked Berlin.
You never worked Berlin...
Are you disappointed?
I'm working on it.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
And why is that?
By who?
Are we hacking or asking?
I don't want to leave.
He has already agreed to come.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Scotland. He intends --
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
No. One of us is enough.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I will not.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Let her speak.
You are. And I'll come again.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
You scare me.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I must... consult with my father.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
But you must have something to go on?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Okay.
What? What could he do?
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Photos?
Like Ozzy.
Huh?
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
Damn. Your dad did this?
Those are your clothes, silly.
I walk differently?
He's a fucking maniac!
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
I get it. You can drop it now.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Which is?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
...yes.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Oh my God oh my God...
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Well?
Thank you, but I hardly think --
I won't.
Come up here a minute.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Practically no one.
Good day.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
I will.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I don't think I will, Rick.
The stairs from the street.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Everything is quite all right.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
No.
And I said I would never leave you.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Thank you. I try.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Yes, rather.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes, I get the point.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Here it is.
Very well.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
We'll be there.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Perhaps not.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Excuse me.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Put that gun down.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Take your hands off me!
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
No.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Then don't have a drink.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Feels so good to lie here.
Take it.
Take it, damn it.
I'm putting it off.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Nothing out there but ocean.
As much as anybody.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
I had it on the island with me.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
You don't seem too happy about it.
For when I travel?
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You want to.
Could you watch Jango?
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A few things came up.  Or went down.
You have any children?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Yeah?
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Don't you even think about it.
What about the sender?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
I braided them.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
San Francisco.  And you?
Life is waiting.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Dr. Homer Wells.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Two.
Burma!
Sure... I'll see you around.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Nothing.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
He's *paralyzed*!
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
He's leaving...
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She looks after other people's children.
Is that soon?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
A B-24 Liberator.
Have you enlisted?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Right.
I guess so...
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Of course.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
It's just my heart.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
What view?
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Everything looks in order.
Two million.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Know who I am, Jake?
And these cops? What do they get?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
I was doing it for them.
Guess so.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
And what about Big Al?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She's up for it.
You sure?
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Very much so.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
We're not cops.
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
What?
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
It's what I do. It's my job.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Where the hell is she?
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Jake? Customs?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
With identification.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Keep it up.
Eee Oott Auught!
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
That's it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
South African women are very sporty.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
Not entirely.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I've got a job.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Marion, stop this.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Leave it.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You will?
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
In the casino.
Just an accident. Nothing.
That's fine.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You choose.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Robbery's not criminal?
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Wait a minute...
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
No thank you.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who...
You did?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Turn left at the lights.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Good call. Help yourself.
I put them on together.
Jack.
No.
I was at Beadles.
We do. 
They've been tested.
I don't gamble.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
No.
Very impressive.
Fine.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Doolittle, are you there?
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Well, there's the possibility of...
All right, then...
I read the same here.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
And I saw that I was alone.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Right!
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Of course not.
Yes, well...
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Any of 'em any good?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Ah... pity, pity...
Doolittle, hello?
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
No?
I'm on a break.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
That's not why we're here.
That's a lotta crap.
No.
No time.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Later.
Am I?
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Something.
You lost me.
You did go through my stuff.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You know what I'm saying.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I actually know how this works.
You get it when I get her.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
I'll give it my best shot.
Easy Sketchy.
Shut-up...
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Got any KISS?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Thanks.
Right, slow...
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
YO, DOOFUS!
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
The paint!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Oh, yeah...?
The easy way.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Uhh... nothing.
That's it?
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
The KISS Army!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Good morning...
Good MORNING!
Yeah.
So... that's it?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
I didn't say shit.
You'll know soon enough.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Hey...
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
And you'd never been there before?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
What?
Infant Memory Generators.
Hey. You OK?
It's safe here.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Do you get to meet Ed?
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
How so?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Yes.
No. That makes you keep searching.
I know.
Yes.
I... I was playing with fire.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
You've done it again?
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Where is he, Donald?
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
How did you know --
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
What else?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Kitty...
Beg pardon?
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Oh God, I'm dead...
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Airport Ho-Jo!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Huh?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
I love you much.
You could be quiet.
My dress'll reek.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
And everything.  He should be king!
The king can do no wrong! 
The king can do to wrong! 
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
"My President"...
Send for my car...
Yes, sir. 
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't call him, I whistle.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
What do I get?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
You told it to me.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I can't do it...
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
I can't do it right away.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
Yes.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Now -- er --
Take a seat -- you're next. 
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
That I am very little different from him.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Yes?
I intend to.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
You've never been?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
...I learned a long time ago.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
You did not ask me.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
That's a canopy, John.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Oh no, I couldn't.
Yes, very soon.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Welcome home, John.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
I said welcome.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Yes.
Five this week; how many the week before?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
I... but I...
The second note to wake the Gods...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well... isn't it great?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Yes... oh, yes...
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
I didn't mean to!
Why... should YOU care?
Come on, move it!
It saved my father!
No.
Sorry.
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Why should WE care?
But you're the Gods!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Well, come on!
Oh... er... yes...
How about making friends?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Over the Edge of the World.
Please.
Do what?
He hasn't.
Your lord.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Hang on...
What have you got there?
Can't make enough swords!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
I must only let the red rage...
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
You liar!
Neither am I.
No, Mother.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
You were not.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I'm Joel.
Yes?
Yeah?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I know a man who needs a refill.
Yeah, I guess.
Thanks.
No, not at all.
Oh, yeah.
That's scary sounding.
Okay.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
It's three.
You're not ready.
Would you get me another, Joely?
What do you mean?
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Come up and see me... now.
You had the whole human race pegged.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think we should go.
Yeah.
Make love?
Oh, um...
I'm nervous, too.
Says you were a bully...
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I guess so.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Long day thinking.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I miss you.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
We'll speak soon.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Sorry. I just --
What?
Where?
Well, what should we do?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Can I... I brought some --
Nothing.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Alexander Pope?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
He went home sick.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Then check the connections.
Patrick, we need to focus.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
The Clock People?
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Justin?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What?
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Oh God...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
Starck!
How do you know all this?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
That is not acceptable --
Negative.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
It's complicated...
If it worked, yes.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
Then who the fuck are you?
Starck, give me a read.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
That's enough!
Captain, we got a problem.
Justin?
Come around to three-three-four...
But you can breathe it.
No. It was someone else.
What is it, Starck?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
What's going on in there, Starck?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I did.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
We're losing atmosphere...
Get them back --
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Do they have pressure?
Yes.
Relax, it's casual.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I'm worried about you.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Five times.
Should?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
You've been working out.
They're not costumes.
Right, whatever, have fun.
But all these people...
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Girl...?!
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Passion.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What...?  Oh.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Are you kidding?
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Hilarious.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
You want to work at Carl's?
This is how I dress all the time.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
No. I want my money back right now.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Okay, Dennis.
Oh, really?
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I don't know.
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I didn't see you this morning.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Yeah?
Damone. It's Mark.
I'm really pretty busy...
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
How often do you go?
Fascinating.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
All right.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Do you think that guy's cute?
Really?
It was okay.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Not since November.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
What?
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
He's not coming.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
No problem.
What about those other guys you live with?
I've heard that, too.
Do you really have to go?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Yes... It makes sense.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Dobermans don't talk.
A major!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
Damn right!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
No, no. Don't leave me!
Why what?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
They were all veterans.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Of course, officer.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
They'll be back.
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
With what just happened upstairs --
Come on, come on.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the head?
Easy.
There's a tunnel.
Follow me.
Just an observation.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He only shot you once.
He shot you the other time.
Huh?
Nothing.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
Move slow and move quiet.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Get something on that.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Amazing you made it this far.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Not without you!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
I said I'm not lying.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Putting on my armor.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Who's this?
You see: We've got to change that name.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Right now we have to be practical.
...Yes.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
We'll get you home, Frances.
Really?
No.
See you next weekend, Dad.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
I know.
Please, Francie...
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Good.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
Why, you... you little bastard!
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
You think I'd miss it?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Quietly.
...So you think I should go.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
I took the early rounds.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Huh?
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
What's that?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
What's that?
Well... you're looking well.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Fine!
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
Your big speech?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Then why did you bring them?
Yes, Mama.
I will, I promise.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
But what -- 
Don't I know you?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Stay calm, please.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Sedate her.
No! No!
The music? Or the fire?
You speak.
How did you find me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
I don't know.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Quite right!
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Is he not back yet?
Nothing can. Not ever.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
It is
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Now husband and wife.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Aye, Captain.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Very well then.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
It's a letter to my father.
Somebody has to!
No. He had more important work.
I've been preoccupied.
Is that your diagnosis?
No. They don't.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Victor, explain yourself.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Are you a physician?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Who are you?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I finished the boats.
Un-hunh.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Artist.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Absolutely.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
For sure.
I had to.
I don't believe you...
That was the telephone.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
I got to.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
So let's do it.
The truth hurts.
I'm exhausted.
Sorry, I need everybody.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
In heaven.
I was a minister.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
Kate, Scott?
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Yes.
Okay.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
That's what I hear.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Don't say my name.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Didn't take long.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Sir?  What did he say?
Smoke her.
Fuck me.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Absolutely not.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Just like you would be.
This has nothing to do with you.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
I saw an article...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Whose orders were those?
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
They had to kill 'em?
Sure, sure.
Smoke it!
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
North?
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Women.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Nesting?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
What do I get?
This is not the place...
Not now. You got my bag?
We? I don't think so.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
I don't think so.
I'll try.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
It's Tatopoulos.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
We know.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
You're standing on it.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
Oh.
Why are you telling this to me?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Is that the bathroom?
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Alex? Where are you going?
Down there.
What?
Excuse me guys.
What's  your name, son?
It's okay. Listen-
Okay...  Okay, now what.
We'd never have the budget for this.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Lt. Madison, GO.
Up.
We're getting major structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
All systems are working, Commander.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
It's ... incredible.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
We're doing episode 31?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
JASON...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Computer, can it be repaired?
Nothing. Hold please.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
But... Inside, I have seen-
But...Why?
You can oc that?
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
I?  You all know my history.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
No.  I guess.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
Lafayette will not be happy...
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
I'm not sure.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Detained by what?
I understand, George.
George!  So good to be back!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
My God, what?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
I want you to see our hospital.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
It is; we need you George.
But not more than your comfort.
That's a lie!
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
Let's get you darker!
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
I have to ask you for that key.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
That's all.
She can't talk right now.
Gimme an hour.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
What three hundred grand?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Ray. Look at me.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
Fuckin' basketball game.
Not really.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
So what's the problem?
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Read it. It's a grabber.
You're kidding, right?
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
He died.
What Get Away jet?
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Martin, look at me.
I believe it.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
I'm up twelve grand today.
I'll find you, Leo...
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
...That's what we finally decided.
I want to know.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
You thought I was faking?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Pick 'n' Save.
Come on in.
You seem to feel fine about it.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
What money?
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
What?
No.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Oh yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I don't know what you're talking about?
If money can buy what he wants.
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
That's what I call a payday.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Did you see him?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
What?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Not our mystery guest again.
That much I think we've already established.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
We could call for help.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
A what?
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Leave it.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
Better late than never.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Fifteen, at the most.
YES.
Not the Maxine?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I guess.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Jesus...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Yeah, well... hi...
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Why?
Forget it...
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
In fact, never.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Everybody's too stupid!
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Where?
He does that every single day.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
You're insane.
What thing?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
I don't believe you.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
What are you doing here, Melorra?
That's not even --
Norman.
You're late, asshole.
Watch my stuff.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What? Why?
Really?
Oh yeah?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
I had to see you.
Do you have anything to drink?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I dunno, I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I will if you want to.
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Yes?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
Don't they, though?
Yes he is.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
Then why do you stay?
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
That is correct.  Nothing.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
What?
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
But of course yours worked.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
This is more difficult-
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Not even close.  What happened?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
I'd rather not.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Does he ever mention me?
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Didn't I do it?
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
Okay, let's take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Good-bye, Peter.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Now you're talking.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
Who are they?
Do I?
Did I forget something?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I knew that.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
And decent.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
Uuuuuuugh!!
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
I am Zuul.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
What?
I'll scream.
You heard it?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Is that a game?
I think it's the food of the future.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What is it?
Has this ever happened before?
You could say that.
In a storage facility.
No, you may not.
The magic word is "please."
See!  They are using drugs.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Two wavy lines?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
I'm always serious.
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Does she want to be?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Oh, shit!
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
I blame myself.
Neutronize.  System shut.
What do we do now?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
No sense worrying about it now.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
If I may be so bold...
You're coming back?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Not yet, dear brother...
That's difficult to say, general.
You flatter me, Caesar.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Until your confirmation date.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
Why you?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
They fear me.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Well, we can try...
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
No!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Alive... I'm alive...
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Hello.
No.
Yes.
I'd love some.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
I just want to tell you something.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
No.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
That woman --
I've never been to it.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here he comes.
Because it isn't true.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I don't understand.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No.
Thank you.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Yes, sir.
Yes I am.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
What?
Because I don't like you.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Is what a girl?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What?
But it's light in there now.
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
No.
I'm very neurotic.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Sit down.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Right.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Of course.
I'll be up in five minutes.
You're welcome.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
What novel did you read.
There!
I walk out.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
What?
Thank you.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Yes.
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
I don't think we were the first.
Why not?
But why shouldn't I?
Then let's hear them.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
But if it's sickening for you --
Thank you.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Then you'd better start believing me.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Sure.
When I go off?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight.
-- worried?
That has nothing to do with it --
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Thank you.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
I'd like to discuss this.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
That what he says. Right?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Not now.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
What about the money?
Not with strangers.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Sorry.
I feel sorry for him.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
For tonight. 
Because you love me -- you love me?
What?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I don't want them now.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Why do you think --
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
I thought she was splendid!
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No, doctor.
Send his bags up to my room.
You're tired. I can see that.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Money!
You don't understand that do you?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Moreover...
Perhaps. 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well, he's a gentleman!
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Shhh -- here he is now.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
All you have to do is phone for it.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
And I said we didn't.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Next week.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
I could not think of not accepting.
Me?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
That.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Bobo, no, I --
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I like you, too.
Fine.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
You know who I work for.
I know.
Why? What's wrong?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Roy Dillon.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
No. And you have to be.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
You don't have the stomach for it.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
This time...
Mm?
All? It ain't bad.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
That's just Lilly's way.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Every day in every way.
We'll rent a car.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
The long end. Big con.
And when he got serious?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Open it and find out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Yes?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Gun?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Not many.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Do I know you?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
It's Amy Kramer.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No shit.
I know.
Yes.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Then you come out here.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
You're unbelievable.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
He's in the bathroom.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Then they can watch.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
It's a rune ... Thorn.
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Wait a minute ...
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Or what's left of him.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
It was you.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
It's a bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
At least!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Go home!
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Really?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
The posies are for her?
I forget mine for years on end.
Our pleasure.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
You actually sold insurance!
I've considered that.
You're making a joke.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
For what?
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Dr. Woodly.
Is anybody besides you here now?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
They were in the same creative writing class.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Will you go to bed?
Scat!
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Leave a tip.
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
No.
I don't want to fight you.
Heaven.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Nothing would please me more.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I did?
A trip, you mean?
Turn around?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
No.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
It's always locked.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And her fiancé!
I've got to run!
I came back.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Are you've seen it work cures?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
What will you do, Colonel?
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Don't worry about it.
Don't!
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
I'll kill myself.
Stay home tonight!
He's alive!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
Still lives with his mother.
How did she lose her feet?
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
He can hardly talk.
Oh?
Keeps fairies away!
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Far as I know.
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
You're saying no.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Take plenty of cigars.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
What?
That's the XKE.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
I'm amazed.
We've got to rescue him.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
You mean I'm black?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Okay.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
What girls you got here?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yes. I think it'll look better.
You know her?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
I am.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
She's dead.
At least I'm a growing person.
'Sucking off.'
You don't understand shit.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
I thought I was fucked up.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
What makes you so sure?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Well, what do they know?
That's right.
No.
But the police...
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Get out!
Like what?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
That's not true, Mr...?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Where!
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Oh.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You working in San Diego now?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
No.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Hello.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Eh, fine.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Because they are all the same.
Well...
Look.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Where's that?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Yes. They're old friends.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
I don't know.
No.
Thank you, Uncle.
Yes, sir.
War is not all black.
You think so, sir?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Julia.
I knew you'd come.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
You a doctor, too?
What's the matter with her?
God, that's terrible.
What?
So you slept O.K.?
Kyle, you don't have...
You were ALL human!
The Cenobites.
You mean, outside... with her.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It was red. Bright red.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Is it bad?
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Anung-un-Rama...
I knew those men better than you did --
Don't move. We --
My job.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Good night.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Goodnight.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
No. Myers is taking me.
Coffee's warming me up.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
What's the problem?
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
HE did. I've seen him.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Oh Christ.
This isn't happening.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
I don't want to see the dress.
I'm very happy.
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
Good.
Who?
You're hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
What?
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
What kind of doors?
Maybe.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Which is where?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Oh my God.
Like who?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
You mean we're moving in?
Oh Christ. Julia...
In here.
Shit.
Larry....
Are you O.K.?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Sure.
Don't go upstairs.
You want something to drink?
I prefer the floor.
I got through.
No Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
You will keep in touch.
Sure.
Of course.
Gone?
Yes!
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
What things?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Well what's the point in that?
Ehh.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
No.  We need the gig.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
I have a television.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
He's not worth it!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
So.  Is now a good time?
What do you mean, four more?
Nice friend.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
It's Vince and Justin.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Think about it, Rob.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
You really believe that?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
No.
What, what?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Is what better?  Better than what?
I haven't felt like it.
We'll talk some other time.
I guess.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Nothing.
You do, huh.
It's me.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Mmm hmm.
Those aren't mine.
Pig died.
Yes, of course.
Mmnn.
Hi.
Harder.
No use.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Not really.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
It's a crematorium.
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Yeah.
That way.  You?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Yeah.
Go to hell.
Claymore.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
It's my birthday.
Thanks.
Why?
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
I don't follow you.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
That bothers you?
You are being foolish.
No one knows you're here?
You had to do _nothing_!
You are.  Now.
Yes.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
I see.
That's insane.
Is that a threat?
All of it finished.
Yes.
What do you want from me?
Spare me the details.
All I need is for you to check the name.
It's that important?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Your name is Conor?
You will live.  Survive.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
But why be so concerned about me?
And you?
I have no future husband.
But I did live.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Certainly not me.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish yours?
Not likely.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
You seem to understand a great deal.
If you wish to play games, Major.
We have no understanding.
It can be different.  It must be.
Stay out of it.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Where did you learn that?
Head still secure to the neck.
You were never a kid.
Not so long.
Of sorts.
Leave her alone.
Are you here?
And if I refuse?
No.
American.
Just your pappy scared some.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
The poem?... The poem was great!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
The money? Why?
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Your luck's not with you now!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
I notice you still remember it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Listen, Walter --
Get away, Svengali.
Please! Will you just --
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Say, could I meet him?
Thanks.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Thank you.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I'd like to think.
I get it!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Huh!
How much do you want on it?
Is he coming back here?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
I'm finished.
You been in a fight?
Was she? Did you notice?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Murder, uh?
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Walter, you can't do that!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
What?
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
You said it!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Give me a hand with her, will you?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
What?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Now what do you say?
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Five hundred dollars.
I'm telling you!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
All right, Judge.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
I'll go right after it.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
That man there!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Don't move!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Forty dollars.
The what?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
I'll explain it tomorrow!
You can't bribe me!
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Why?
Very well, Grandpa.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Yes.
Sod.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
...and four and five...
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
They might be.
Air-raid?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Naturally.
I will if you will!
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
You taste it.
Up to six weeks, I think.
Grace!
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
I know you mean well.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
OK.
Come on.
A dead one.
Nice.
Great story Goober, how much?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't drive cross country.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Turn that fucking radio off!
It's a girl.
Where ya headed?
There's a dog in the road.
What!
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
That kid is one horny retard.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Tickets for what?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
You got to be fucking joking.
I can't believe...
I don't know... about half an hour.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
What do they call you, sweety?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Great.
Huh?
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
Let's go see.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Call Wydell.
Dr. Satan?
I pray to God there is.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Aw, fuck.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
We found one.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
French?
Oui.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Of course not.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Shh.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
God, you're beautiful.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
I don't know.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Really?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Lila, I want to help you.
Where?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
I'm not sure.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Nathan!
Yes, darling.
That's very funny.
He looks perfectly fine.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Your entire body?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
I guess.
Such as what womanly things?
That was wonderful!
Ummm. It's good.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Ugnh.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Lila?
Yahoo!
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
here, here.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Yes... Derek.
How?
That's the way it's done.
Good, good.
Deal the cards.
It's possible.
Twelve thousand.
Two.
You being cute?
Whaddya been so far?
Thanks for the drink.
Why?
For who?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
You hustlin' me?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
It's a long walk.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Aaaahhhh!
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Would you like to come out tonight?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Fine, thanks.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I drink.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Come here.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Thanks.
Eggs. How do you like them?
What's this supposed to mean?
Me. It's Eddie.
Why did he tell you?
Is he a winner?
I love you.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Why?
Well, what's the matter?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Twelve. Cross side.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
You watch me.
Thousand dollars a game.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Have you always had it?
Have you looked inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
If we want it, it is.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Good night.
About what?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
Hide the car.
I know a way.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
What?
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
David, don't...
He's a good man.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
More than likely.
So sue me.
Checkmate.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Dad...
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
Oh shit, we're late.
I had a feeling you would.
Then God help us.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Yes, Sir.
Better than we thought.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Yes, I am.
Butt-munch.
Jimmy, stay with me.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
You sure?
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
But, Mr. President...
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Arghhh! Oh!
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
How dare he?!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Are you sure?
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
What?
You said go between them!
Mine, too.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
Where is it? I want it.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
All I have to do is scream.
Junior!
Head for the fireplace!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Brody's this way.
What final challenge?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
I know, Dad!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Come on -- come on!
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
No.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
Just a routine inspection tour.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Lao She.
I don't like to show off.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
You don't like him do you?
Yeah, that's what happened...
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
He told me they knew I was coming here.
The old man saw it in a dream.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Just one arm!
THE WHAT?!
Keep stroking it!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Don't catch cold.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Willie!
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
You've got to go to sleep now.
Yes.
You got it!
I know you did!
Don't do that.
Yes.
I just got here.
Yeah?
No.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who am I?
No.
I just went there for a job.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yeah.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Outrun them.
Too late...They want you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
You gotta help.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Take a left and your next right.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
I'm at the airport.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Just get there.
What? What do you mean?
Try another language.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Well you did it today.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Not blue enough.
You have no taste.
Who, me?
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
I don't know!
It wasn't like that.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I can't see a thing.
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Keep thinking.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
That's nice.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
It's all we've got.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Do what? What'd you do?
Dieter?
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Let us get to the border!
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
He work for us?
That name's familiar.
What?
What things?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Who...are you?
Thanks.
Well what?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Not you. Them.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
What's what?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
I didn't say anything.
Blake?
Why?
You are.
Why do you do it?
...Naw. Made that up.
Hires you for what?
How often they come here?
You seemed interesting.
You did.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
You coming along?
Can you?
That I really don't know.
It was my choice.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
You are, I've seen you.
Why not?
Yes.
Poor bastard.
So we better get started.
Hi, Daddy.
For reading.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Lunch?
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is your gun?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Okay. 
"Mike?"
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Catch you later.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Call me back in ten.
Okay.  Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
No, thank you.
Did you say Berman?
"60 Minutes"?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
...you fucked me!
Alright.
That's right...
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, please, Mike...
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Good.  You have kids?
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
It's obvious, isn't it?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
What?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Well, what do you really think, though?
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
It acts as a drug on the body?
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
When should we do this?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Chapter and verse.
Here. Got pictures.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I had no idea until after, but --
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
No...
No frown lines.  New watch?
Got any symptoms?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
Thanks, buddy.
What do you mean, was.
Why do you think she did it?
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Isn't everything?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You don't believe in it.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Gotcha.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
But why him?
So I hear. Is that all?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
No. Don't stop.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Me. Yes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Your mother was.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Yes. Again.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
You can't prove anything.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's blackmail.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
You have some?
Jesus.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
He has a reputation for being tough.
I'm dying.
So where are you now?
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
I guess.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I don't know. I can assume...
Well -- is that possible?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
I am very sorry.
HA!
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Mother?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
Yeah.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Why? Do you know him? 
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Yes, of course.
I haven't the slightest idea.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Thanks.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
You win!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Yes.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
You must have me confused with—
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Shut up!
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Smart aleck!
Outside!
I can't go out like this.
Like this. I have no robe.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Um. You're doing all right.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
I refuse to resign!
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
No.
Of course it is.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
was so scared—that it scared—
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
A black eye. 
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Yeah, swell.
I love you.
Who—me?  Want to see me?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
Isn't he here?
Get out!
Yeah.
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
I dunno.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Who?
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
There's a seat over there for you.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Thanks. 
Why?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
What's the other name?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Calm down, Dave, what?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I had the cause of death.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No, you don't!
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
David Ferrie.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Take a look across the street.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
We need him back.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
More than ten years.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
And Oswald?
She's the best damn witness we have!
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Yes?
That sounds fun.
Six.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Who?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I found out.
What time do you have to be there?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Take your time.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Can you do it or not?
I thought you might want a drink?
It's kind of a sports bar
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Yeah.
Are you?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's not really something I think about.
Bigger?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
What'd ya see?
How was it?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Right around here, in the food court.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
When did you decide?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
What if I've figured a way?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
It's not that simple.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Not every day?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Yeah?
You never asked me if I did or not.
Who's the other one?
Was she there?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
I thought you were watching him.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Beaumont Livingston?
Kinda.
Yeah, do you like it?
They told me.
Go sit over in that chair.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Talk to you tomorrow.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
What'd you care?
She don't know shit about the money.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Two months shy of four years.
It's a diet thing?
No thanks.
Yeah.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
No.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Yeah, down the end.
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
What do I do?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
You're outside?
I'm in my underwear.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Yep.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You know how she is.
Pretty sure.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
It's in there.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Haven't a clue.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Git your ass in here.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
That I gotta see.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Yes.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
No problem.
Give me his home number.
No, thanks.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Oh God!
Stop!!!!
What do you want from me?
Oh, terrific.
It's hard to explain.
They're not interested, Jake.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
What?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I don't know what to say.
Hell, you think I am?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Whataya mean, no record?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
I didn't want to wake you.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
I don't know.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Why you left.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where?
Show me Della!
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
Jezzie?
Let go!
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
I'm tired.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Then don't bug me.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Shows how much you knew.
Like it was yesterday.
Hot. Where do I sign?
For what? For seeking the truth?
Total delirium.
Help me!
Where am I?
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Why the hell we drivin' here?
What's goin' on Paul?
Why not?
You come home with me.
Died?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Pour it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Speaking of which, duck!
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
We don't have a choice!
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
What are you doing back?!!
Thorgan, suit up.
Thorgan? You coming?!
Then stop talking and work faster!
Suit up.
I am an expert!
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if we don't?
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Not so bad.
I get it.
She needs a little time.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Again?! Jesus!
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Just get us to the ship!
Crutch?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Who are you apologizing to?
Keep trying!
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
4You're not going anywhere.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Old Earth?
What have I done?! Idiots.
My boat's neat, dad!
You got it.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Where is he?
Michael! Come inside!
Can you do that?
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
Do I need any more authority?
I didn't agree to that!
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
My kids were on that beach...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
You could say that.
What stinks so bad?
Florida license plate.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
I wish it would rain...
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I can't imagine why.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Some friends and me took a house.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
That wasn't funny.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Let me see your hands...
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
And I'll drink to yours.
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
I don't think so.
Thanks for the message.
Cool.
I'm supposed to be running.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Um, hi?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
No...
Huh?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Okay.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Hey, I like this.
You don't have to do that.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
What?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
I went to the doctor today.
This is the baby. Your baby.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Congrats.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Thundercats are go!
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
I am a suicide risk.
Unfortunately, yes.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
Right, seriously.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Not really.
Sure.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
What'll we do out there?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Turkey mostly.
Best kind.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
How much do I owe you?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Nah... how much money have you got?
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Thanks. What are you doing?
A book on the warehouse murders?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Not yet.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
No, thanks, I can manage.
No.
Everybody just shut up!
Who are you?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
You fucked it?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
You think he's got any herb?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Right.
Right.
Yep.
Yeah me too nigga.
Who?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Bet.
Why I do what?
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Yeah.
Shut the fuck up.
Hold up man.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Yeah.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hold on.
You have?
You were?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. I can understand that.
Come on.
I like you too.
How do you know?
Nothing?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Because, you know why. You know.
Why is that?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
I tested positive?
What?
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Everything is wrong.
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah is dissdee?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
You think so?
He still does.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
OK.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
No.
What?
Maybe you should.
I'm positive.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
Maybe he's going to drug her?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
Sanderson?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
Did you know her?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You're not going to tell me that.
Because she's the type.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
The game's over.  You lost.
No!  Wait!!
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Thanks.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Boys.
No Frank.  No prints.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Anything else?
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
That's a big area to cover.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
I got it from the tournament directory.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
It doesn't make sense.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
It's alright.
How come you don't stay with them?
No.  I don't.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
You're not?
What's wrong?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
What?
But I do.
Why not?
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
He didn't tell you either.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
<u>What</u>?
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
That way. I can feel the cold.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Does the Queen live?
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
Each to his fate.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
You will follow me.
To the place where Death lives.
I'm all right.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
At the gallop!
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
I don't think it's working.
You had better manners as a pig.
Look at its insides.
Then he will die!
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
How many did you lose?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
The Widow of the Web?
Fewer will survive them.
It is too late. He has drunk.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
We had no children.
No.
Why do you want to know?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
OK.
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
I never rent my gear.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Don't you like me?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
...Yes.
Nothing, for the moment.
Yeah, what?
...I got lost, Mister.
I have no fear.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yes... Twice.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
You do?
We can do it together.
I don't follow.
You're talking to me?
Don't be so sure.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Not our problem.
Not our problem.
Jumped where?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You tell stories?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Making the grand total?
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
I told you.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Where am I?
Steph.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
Forty-seven years.
Hello.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
Water?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
You what?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
What?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Yuri... are you...
I have a 4.0.
I can't tell you.
Get up.
You're fired. I have new representation.
That's not what's important.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Just the love in my heart.
See?
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I don't know.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
You know her?
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
Yes, you are.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Your scrunchie?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Power yoga?
What?!
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
She's completely untrustworthy.
But maybe it is --
Maybe not to your face...
No, she can't move for an hour.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Oh, my God!!
What, like on va-kay?
Absolutely!
Of course, I do!
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
See?
Chuck.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Why do you say that?
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
What will become of me then?
I see...
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Jack, don't!
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
The chill is worse this night.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What weapon?
Patience, lad.
Never show mercy!
I've not heard a note out of you.
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
And did you?
I'll try.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
If you like.
I may have said perhaps...
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Stop complaining.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
Only what's right...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
She's dead!
You'll visit again?
Sorry.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Do I not please you, Jack?
You... you... you mortal you!
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
It's done... we'll never catch him.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
May God protect you.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
I thought I might stop by.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Mom said I should.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
What's wrong?
You'd better call and cancel.
I'll survive.
What's that?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
You look better without make-up.
Yeah.
Really?
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
I don't want you to!
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
I'm not gay.
Okay.  I guess.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
It could have been a squirt gun.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
I've been dreading you.
And if I enclosed it?
A sink?
If that's what it takes.
I'm not.
Maybe that's too long.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
She's out with a friend.
Uh huh.
I want you both to stay.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
To check up on me?
You don't have a choice.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
You're so predictable.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
You'll have money when you work for it.
Oh, okay.
I might have a solution.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
What I'm not.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Here.
I'd build a house.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I need you to do me a favor.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You let him pierce his nose?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Why call me?
I want him with me.
I don't have a phone.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
What?
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
This was my very first slow dance.
I smiled at him.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I can't pick you up.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
Take it off.
Do you like red?
Hey.
I don't know what I'm doing.
And the baby?
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She got married last month.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Claude Banks.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What'd you say?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
It ain't here.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
That's the way it is.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Go where, Ray?
I said you're soft.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You didn't get ketchup?
I'm all right.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
Rayford!
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Something like that, yes.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Anybody else need anything read?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
That's a long story...
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
It's not me, moron.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Yes, Jimmy.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Definitely.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Coulda been much worse.
It's Stanley, sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
We know where to find Nicky.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
All right...
I'll just go to Heaven.
Andrew.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
I have to, Valerie.
From my dad's side of the family.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Anything to eat?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Where do you send them?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
It has nothing to do with you.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I'm very smart.
He was killed.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
I thought I had to do something.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I let him go... believe me.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
But what is this -- why?
He's good, isn't he?
They won't believe us.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
We'll be all right...  We will...
I doubt it.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Oh, my...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
For as long as I can remember.
I have always been here...
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
No, no, no
More... many more.
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
No, I'm okay.
What?
This is our bedroom.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Or something.
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
I don't know.
So what do we do?
I used to.
Pete... Don't...
Yes.
Alice?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down.
Yeah? what did they want?
What happened to me?
The wife killer?
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The first night... Not the last two.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Wake me up when you get home.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Maybe.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
But...
Was there?
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
It'll be ready.
You know who it is.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
It was weird...
I don't want to talk about it...
Come on.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
I beg your pardon.
Good morning—
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
That's ridiculous.
It certainly is.
Oh, really?
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
I'm thinking.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
Yes.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
All right.
Nothing. Why?
Leaving?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Who, for instance?
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Pardon me—
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Hey!
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Mine?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Yes, Bob.
Dead?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Why - I'm sorry - but I—
Is that all my story meant to you?
She's going with me.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
Yes, everything!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
Where are we going? Huh?
My name's Sondra.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Why?
I'd love it!
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
I guess I lost:
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Actually, sir--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Sir, you can't just--
What?
She didn't even know you. .
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's check am out.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
We're rising.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Kay!?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Why not?
Out of focus?
Are you sure you don't?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
How could it not?
Yeah, Kay?
Actually, yeah--
Will it lower the curve?
What the hell is going on?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Can you see?
Anderton --
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Who wanted her little girl back?
She's still alive?
Anne Lively...
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
They were performance pieces.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
... Graveyard shift.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Lara --
Uh-huh...
I'm fine, Lamar.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Run the subscription list...
Georgetown.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
That was easy.
Because it was going to fall.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Some -- somebody's father?
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
What the fuck is going on?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
We know why John was tagged.
I'll be right there.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Where are you?
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
I don't understand --
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
How?
I wanna kill my boss.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
We can stop him.
How many?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
I know who you are.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
But John was with him at the pool?
You're Bobby, right?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Is it a good room?
Is it the good room?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
He's not doing it.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
5-5-1.
You driving her?
Get away from her.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
No.
Ricky's taken care of.
Pshhh...
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
What?
He'll work it off.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Take a few days --
Good morning.
You don't know where you're going?
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Ruiz isn't here.
Shhh...
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
Bullshit...
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Who's driving her?
To keep?
Nah, don't bother --
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Well, I don't want to walk.
Nothing.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
Like I said, I don't know.
You would think.
You too?
Back in.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
It was six in the fucking morning.
Easy...
Fuck...
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
The line's over there.
You see a Ricky Slade?
What?
He's on the list.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Watch it...
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Word.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Different.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're square.
What?
Tell me.
Yes, sir.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
A rose by any other name would --
Bet you like that shit.
Man's rep travels.
I'm working on it.
Nnnnnnn!
You never had it.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
I sure met some.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Tell Him that.
No, Brother Minister.
She ate.
How do you like it?
Are you?
What have you set your mind to?
I know.
Yes.
Yes. Did you eat?
You're with me even when you're away.
Because you're in trouble.
I'm not made of glass.
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Shhh!
Dear heart, I love you.
Betty it's me. It's me.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
I told you we don't know for certain.
You put it very well.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Let me do it then.
Allah Akbar.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
I ain't stupid.
Murder.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
The hell you are.
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
I don't know shit about you.
So you are going to talk me to death.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
It's a little late.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
[Si.]
[Daniel what?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[No!]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[I believe you.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[You stole the drop.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
It's loaded.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Nothing wrong.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
I came to visit you.
Maybe...
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Pinta...
Different door. Not far from here.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Why not?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
Yes.
I know you're not.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
So are you.
I'm fine.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Because...  I was already dead.
Then don't come.
It's Creasy.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
You do?
[And left three more dead men.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
So am I.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What was she to Creasy then?
Oh, yeah.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
What for?
It must be one o'clock.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
We just talked.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I came to see you. How you feel?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
I know it pains.
I'm having a very good time, too.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Yes, I know.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Please...
How do you do?
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
You gotta good heart.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty...
You gonna die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
I don't know. I don't think so.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well...
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
You talked to Walt?
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Hospital.
Or her figger.
Same general idea.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
We been had.
The chest-cutter.
Sixteen times.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
But what about Major Houlihan?
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
No, no, that one.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
Something else we have in common.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
You think he won't.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
There's only one worth noticing.
That. It's out of the act.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
You mean who hit who?
I did. First and only blow. So far.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Who?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
No, thank you.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
You bet I will, Ma.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
In what man!
What John Doe?
So?
Well, you're catching on.
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Plus a bonus.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Thank you.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
I ain't seen him for a week.
Yeah, a little.
I used to pitch.
Shut up!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
It must be some kind of a gag.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Why—uh—
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Nineteen!
That's too bad.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
How?
Yeah.
What?
SWAT wants to go in.
Deal.
Good. I don't want to be late.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
What happened, Mike.
I need to get something straight first.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
I what?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Roper, we're into it...
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Spread it out.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Sorry... Habit.
Only at the very end.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
We could fill it with water.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Every couple of months, huh?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
I think so.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
We lost.
Damnit!
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
So what do you want to do?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Only that floor.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's okay. We broke up.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Prude.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Depends. What's up?
Your concern is heartwarming.
You let us worry about that.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
Yes, I believe he has --
Okay...
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Yes.
In here I am.
Yes...
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
What?
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Why?
Good question.
Katie was digitized.
If she's alive, you get it back.
-- You told me.
Way you kiss me.
Not you.  A copy.
This.  No point to it.
Just like that?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
We could smell it's breath.
A stellar idea, Skull.
There's enough for everybody!
BULK!!
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Look closer.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
But I've never served a day.
Not another word.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Whatever you say, Boss.
No. Not everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
I was calling yesterday.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Gives us something in common.
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
They don't give a shit about us!
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
They're friends of our enemy.
Not if they all die at once.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Jesus.
Fuck 'em.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Kill them! Kill them!
Just wanted ta say hello.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Stu Miley.
I didn't say anything.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Thank me next time you see me.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Tell me what?
Got a doctor on duty.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
He called me "Doc."
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
The ring...
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I'm good.
Behind the books.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
I'm sorry.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
What does he do?
And where is she?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Forty-five all total.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
Looks like it, but--
It couldn't be.
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
No!
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Yeah. What about the second act?
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Yeah. Funny--
Waiter!
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Tonight?
I'll cherish ya.
Is the wind tired out there?
Have *you*?
Well, let's get going.
What?
Susan? Nah!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
What is it?
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Oh, a *boy*!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Why, of course.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
For a question!
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he yield for a question?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
How's Amos, Ma?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Punch?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Oh, just a day--
Why?
We're over in the House.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Terrible, thank you.
Why?
No!
Great.
Must have been tickled pink.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Second drawer.
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Hurray!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Wonderful!
How are the pigeons?
Then you *did* say it.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Well! You don't say!
Ring the call to quorum.
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
What's the matter?
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Well, well!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Always.
He sure is.
I haven't.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes!
NO!!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
What did they say?
It's wonderful.
That depends on what they see.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
He did?
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
I'm crucifying him.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
We're not going out tonight.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Had the boys follow us.
Yes.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Me, sir?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar!
Wants to know who the heir is.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
All set.
All right.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Who - me? No.
What for?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Nah.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
No, thanks.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Ja.
Huh?
Oh. That.
Well, I play the tuba.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Yeah. What?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Every man to his taste, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
Looking for?
You try it.
Yeah.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yes, sir.
Me more than most.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Right now?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Mr. Follett.
Stop now.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Go to hell.
It's a thought I had.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Mr. Gilroy --
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
A little.
I do.
I'm sorry, your honor.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
You like me. How come?
...so accomplished.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Martin.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Mumford... like the town?
Mother... go away!
There's something I think we need to talk about.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Be specific.
Is that like a party trick?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
That's... good?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I think so.
Hello.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But...
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Anything... just ask.
Will you wait for me?
It's a big part of the show.
It's called pro bono.
It's my bit for the community.
What happened today?
True. Should we stop them?
What'd he say?
He agreed?
Don't you like this?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Yep.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Things got a lot worse.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
See you Thursday... regular time.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Relax, I got him.
And then killing your sister.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Intestines.
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Water turning to blood.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
Proceed!
Broad?!
Oh that's comforting.
What are those mirrors for?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Who was talking about what?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Very slowly.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
That just makes you more gullible.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
What?
I know you knew I'd know.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
One last tweak.
When was that?
The Inscrutable Six?
But you're a superhero.
Me, too.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Or even what it looks like.
I thought you'd never ask.
Hello?
Sure.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
I got it.
Really?
I'm not that kind of girl.
I saw him walk you home.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Me, too.
Monica, where are you?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Yes.
My heart died a long time ago.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Are you coming or not?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
No.
We're superheroes.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
But... the silverware?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
The bazookas?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But how do we get in?
It's suicide.
Great timing!
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
And, what a delightful idea!
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
No, sire... I was asleep.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Let me see it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Four o'clock.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
What is that?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, I am, sir.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Are you trying to insult me?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Of course.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I know what you're doing in there.
What are you doing in there?
Will you be joining us, soon?
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
My God, what do you think?
I know.
Yes.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Oh, then you are...
Of course, my dear.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
We have a treaty with Austria.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Yes, sir.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Why you say that?
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Black magic.
Cheeco.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
You don't know Baby D.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Out the door and to the left.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Better sooner than later.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
It's alright.
Smokin' what?
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Nice to meet you?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
You damn right that's the big one.
Negative...they vamped.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Why did he go in the house?
Thanks for the help.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Keep pushing.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I'll take you later.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
I got my mase.
What's the matter?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I would also like to apologize.
Same to you.
I'd like to know what...
Good.
Yes, I'm listening.
The gun...
Then I have time for a drink.
Tell me why I miss him.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Let me talk to her again.
I want'to talk to her.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I think you're right.
Nods.
Right.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Keep it.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I don't think so.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
You're a big girl, huh?
'Daddy has to go now.
What gives?
Hm!
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
How's your sister Pearl?
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
A man of the Cloth?
Bluebeard!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Mister Powell!
Amen.
How?
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
She's gone to Moundsville.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
John, where are we g --
Up river.
I'll make coffee.
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I don't know nothin'!
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
You could save him, little bird.
Come to me, boy!
What secret shall I tell?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Because John said I mustn't.
Pearl and John.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
No, Harry! I thought --
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
She took them kids with her?
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
The Drugstore?
I sure as hell hope so.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Get the kit!
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Okay, okay.  I think.
No.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Who?
My dream.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Okay. Hi, dad.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Nan, I --
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, but...
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
I don't mean her --
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
'Anything funny' like what?
How you know that?
School.
Right.
Put that damned thing down!
Dead and gone.
Go on...
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Jungle man fix Jane.
It's from Paris.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
An omelet.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
What was it like?
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
Possibly.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
What is it?
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
You didn't get legal advice?
That's right.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Good morning, Gaston.
Go to bed.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
What did she say about me?
Brave... that's right.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
That's even better.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Even the swallows are back.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
What?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You're welcome.
I'll try.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Please don't misunderstand me...
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
No, that was restful. Again.
Why?
At what?
Why?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Do you like Scotch stories?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Anything, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
A funny story?
Darling, darling... please!
Shhh! Shhh!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Much happier.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
But I can throw it out of the window.
It is their wish.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Oh, yes.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes.
What is this, Swana?
What?
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
I must insist that you leave.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
Can you recommend a restaurant?
How do you do, my friend.
My jewels?!
Where the hell is he?
So ... let's go ...
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Yes ... I got the money.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
You do it.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Yeah?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
'Night, Al.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
So?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Silence!
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Money.  Follow the money.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
What?
Sir?
I believe you're right, boss.
No ...
What about happiness, Mother?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
Yes ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
What?
Yes.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
The White House.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Agreed.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
I was the lesser of two evils.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
That'll be the day.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
Mr. Nixon.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
Ernie Davis.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
The hell with 'em.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
No, sir ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Are you serious?
Is that the truth?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
And then you'll be happy?
Can I just ask for one thing?
I've missed you.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You personally?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
When?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
The "crises"?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
You don't know what he thinks.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Try "old" on for size.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No.
You figure him for a dope runner?
I don't know...
No. Probably I don't.
Wasn't no bullet.
No sir.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Well. If you say so.
No. But I gave my word.
Yes. Things fall into place.
It's full a money.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
That'll work.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
You should be used to that.
What did you tell him?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Yeah? Where am I?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
No. Do you?
Yes.
I was just passin' the time.
I don't know. Will there?
What time do you close?
You married into it.
Everything.
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Okay.
No sir, it's unusual.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Okay. We can stop that.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What else then?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I know how he found me.
I'm retired.
I didn't say braze.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
You do, I reckon.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
You think a woman did that?!
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Anyway, so what?
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Oh. How come?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
I am?
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I better go check on them.
...what're you saying?
I don't think I am.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Oh, Betty --
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Ad lib?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I'd slap his face.
Los Angeles, California.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Like Rome?
...did I win some contest?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
God, that's awful!
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Who?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
...okay.
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
No, that should be more than --
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
I don't follow...
My socks?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
...among others.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
What the hell's the matter with you?
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
What's wrong with you?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
"Injuns?"
I'll think about it.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
She's a lesbian.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Mr. Campbell?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Do not seek the treasure!
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Fire! I hate fire!
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Okay, Pappy.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
In any state.
Helluva awgazation.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Not out the other side his face, though.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Don't I know it.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
It was in his bureau.
You didn't know that at the time!
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
But... but...
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
I been calling for four months.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
What for?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Not exactly, sir.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
I'm doing okay, sir.
It's important, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No.
No, sir.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
He was. He died.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Let's just wait and see what happens.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
One more minute.
What do you mean?
No. I never feel like that.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
My kinda group!
I know who you are and what you want.
I'll get it if you want.
Does it still hurt?
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
When I'm good and ready.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Your real father?
I've seen better.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Naw.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Peace out.
The fuck did you do that for?!
I have the gun.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Not that one.
This was your department, Junior.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Pure idiot.
Shut up.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Everything okay?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Open it.
No fucking way.
Don't.
That room!
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Say fuck.
Don't though. 
Blue is phones?
Uh uh.
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Fuck that, we've got company...
What are doing with yours?.
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Yeah, it's me.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
You know that's bullshit.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Naw... I gotta...
Can you make a deal with them?
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
We're like policing the police.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Yeah... let me think about it.
They were empty...
What, I don't know how you mean?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Yeah.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Just the legit shit.
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Bullshit...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Thank you.
That would be nice.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Do you?
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Sir.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
I don't care.  I hate him.
I stand corrected.
Balderdash!
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Gabriel.
Long time.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Goodbye, Harry.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
Earned.
Worse.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yaay!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
I know.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Do you believe that?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Sure.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You keep saying that.
Whose burying ground?
Because it's right.
What did we do, Jud?
It's Ellie's cat.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Did you see his shirt?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
I got eggs down here!
Yes, I guess I do.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Aye, aye, sir!
You can't.  I can.
Elizabeth goes free!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
What're you suggesting?
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Thank you, sir.
Can I trust you?
Commodore, you can't do that!
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
The trees are taller.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Exactly.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
We're catching up!
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
I don't think that will be necessary.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
This way!
Jack!
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
My apologies, Governor.
Where did he come from?
No.  She hasn't.
Please.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
The nanobot is gone.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Been out for six months now.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
That was 'simple'?
Got it.
That's right.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
What did you want my hair for?
Getting used to it.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
I remember I was trying to help...
Oh yeah?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Don't worry, four eyes.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
You may go, Smythe.
No - give you another guess.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
How-di-do.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
I'm glad.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I see.
Stewart!
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
A what?
Well!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Not since you broke into society.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Nothing.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Sorry, boss—
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
I have it here.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
You don't.
Hello, Joe.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Are the cars ready?
I beg your pardon?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
I understand, sir.
The name is Smythe.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Me, sir?
Well, sir, I putter.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Yeah?
Sure.
It doesn't matter.
It can't be possible.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
In my handbag.
Hello Bill.
I'm sorry ...
But I really should get home.
Um ... It's ...
... Lover's Lane.
It is?
Okay, that's IT!!!
I'm fine--but thank you.
Thank you very much.
No. Of course not.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Yes I do.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
... Yeah.
What?
Hunh?
Sure ...
I like it too.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
That's right.
Ooomph?
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
I can't.
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Oh--well ...
Why?
No you're not.
I'm going to leave now.
Just gimme the damn remote!
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Forget about that!
Just a little--You know.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Yeah. 
So you can't talk to me?
And what was this?
That's it.
Ok. Thank you.
Somewhere in Utah.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Why?
No.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I don't know.
What?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I have no idea.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Hi, is this Jack?
This is Georgia.
I'm in my bedroom.
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
No.
Georgia.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I don't have a girlfriend --
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
I don't know.
Not very well.
Yes I do.
It's terrible, no.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Are you guys hurt?
Sure.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
About six months.
Yes.
Ok.
This is Lena.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok.
Ok.
About six months ago. Why?
This really looks like Hawaii here.
This is funny.
For what?
What is this?
You can't do that.
For what?
Did you do it?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
You're hand is bleeding.
I know.
Why?
I didn't do it.
Sorry.
That's fine.
......and this is confidential?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I think you have a call?
....I have seven.
Like a psychiatrist?
Yes I'm fine.
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Hi.
You have an ATM?
You have another house somewhere or something?
Alright, alright.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
When can you leave?
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
Ok.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
It's fine.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
At your service, Count.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
What? What've I done?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
That's enough.
Good day, Marquis.
Valcour. His chair.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
An innocent child is dead.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
And his writing?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
And place my reputation at stake?
And my own.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Quite.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
There's something else I want from you.
Is it awfully violent?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
I don't believe it!
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Go on, child.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
And I in yours.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
....shame on you, truly...
You've come to lecture me?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
But it's just begun --
Am I?
Houdini mice.
And he did.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
And director.
Why is that, Louis?
One . . . buys things.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I will not defend my life to you--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You needn't use that language with me
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I will not have this in my home.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I don't want you to--
Sir, I-
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
I can't remember the lines!
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
We're using-
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Can I talk to Hearst?
Telling stories.
Showing life
The old man has his own way of doing things
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Okay, boy wonder, what?
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Listen to me-
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
They don't have to.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
But it's not a great syllable
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
I don't care.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
What does this have to do with--?
Thank you-
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Yes
Get out
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Ah, it's a grand title.
The ad..
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
I really think you're
It was fun, wasn't it?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Yes!
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
I'm Ok.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
How can he embarrass you?
And where you goin'?
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hit me in the face.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Whadda you care?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What did Tommy say?
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
No, I just told you what happened.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Should I hit it?
Can you see it?
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Oh, Jake.
No, I'm not.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, what?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
Why don't you just call him?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Excuse me for living.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Not yet.
Who left -- where?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
All the things I hate.
Like an old hambone?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Did you get my note?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
It crashed, didn't it?
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
I don't want to.
She's all right.
She pay you much?
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Uh-huh.
You called the police?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
There's something buried there.
There's probably one in the basement.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
How much do you think you'll need?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Only because it's expected of her.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
I wish there was one I wanted.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Something too frightful to utter.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
Someone not his wife?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
How?
Two minutes.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
I'm cute, too.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
No--
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Yes.
I'm not hungry.
Shoot, Jimbo.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Will you wait a minute?
I don't want to learn that!
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
You don't?
Sorry.
Sure.  Sure.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Yes, sir.
Head-shrinker?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Who knows.  Plato?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
I'm here.
I've got a gun.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What's that got to do with it?
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
No.
I don't know why--!
And your folks didn't understand?
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Yes, ma'am.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Who lives?
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Oh.
A what?
No.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I felt like it.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Are you?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Hi.
He hates me.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel, let him go --
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
To all those cons...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
He'll be dead when he does.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Radio said.
No, no --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Yes it was all you --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Nick...
You saved me.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
They all are. Football's on.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Yes!
What?
A station wagon in Canada.
No. It's her brother.
Hey.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Nnn... nothing...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Mr. Bangs.
What?
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Acid-chewer.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Oh, man --
Haven't thought about it.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
I'm just saying.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
What, working security?
Standing right here, man!
GUARD!!!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
...for Christmas...
And you set me up.
You gave them me.
I... sorry, Mister...
Well...sorry...
I'M NOT NICK!
They changed the layout.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Elois?
Where was she from, Compton?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it!
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Dead as Dillinger.
Give me my book.
How many employees?
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Freddy Newendyke.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Down to my car.
You didn't ask.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
Fuck all that.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
How can you be so sure?
Where?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
He ain't dead.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
We don't think this place is safe.
You takin' his side?
What are you gonna do about him?
Yeah, those guys too.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
He's learning his letters.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
Thanks.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Why do you think?
What?
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
All right -- it's said!
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
I'm sorry.
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
How'd you happen to miss?
Good thing you didn't.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
What's there to be fair about?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Yes, people make me restless.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
They shouldn't have done that.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
He certainly could. About a month.
How many ways can a man say no.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
I sure would.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
That's the end of the line.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
No.
Steve --
Alex, what are you doing?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Okay.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
He's so brave.
No. I never date outside my race.
Yeah.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Huh?
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
But he'll kill her!
It's okay.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Made you say it!
I don't need your help.
My child, you're alive!
My child you are the only survivor.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Uh, uh.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Theo, did you see the animal?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Who?
How are we going to get them all up there?
In about fifteen minutes.
Right. What about condoms?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Father, come in, please.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
What?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
You don't think...
Jeeezzz!
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
But Mom, the video's not over.
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
That's right.
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
We can be real quiet...
What a mess.
Yes, I did.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
COCKSUCKER! 
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
I certainly was not!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Yes, I was.
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
I do, please.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
You forgot something...
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I'd like to get out of here.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
Drink.
Thank you.
What sort of danger?
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
She can only use cash.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
I'd like that.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
We could tell him.
Not from me.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And then?
I'm at sea, Jason.
Devil worshippers!
I can imagine.
I have to go —-
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
They may have been friends of hers.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What a peculiar question.
But why come to me?
I'd forgotten.
I think it's time.
Perhaps
I don't know.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Why?
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Of course.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
Yes?
Why
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
No. Why?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
You're in therapy?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Ann. Hello.
All of these are interviews?
Everything about sex.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Why not?
I have money.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
How come?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Why not?
Yes.
Why not?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
No.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Mmmmm...
Why don't I believe you?
Always the lawyer.
Yes!
Yes.
You bitch. I knew it.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
No, I haven't.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Well, I wonder why.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
And... do whatever it is you do.
What kinds of questions?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Why did you do that?
I can't believe you did that!!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
You want me to leave?
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
That's all.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
I can't talk you into it?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Why?
You're intrigued?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
You know what I mean.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Right.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
What do you mean?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
It'll just be me.
You have family here also?
Where are the tapes, Graham?
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Hi. Want a drink?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
OK. But late.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Nick, you're so strange...
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
It's crazy.
Who was she?
OK. I'll think about it.
That you, Rog?
No? How come?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
BREAKING OUT
What?
He needs help.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Who trusts experts?
Yes, Betty.
He was a President.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it, Ralph!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Why?
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
You're practically naked!
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Farley!
Fast!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
What does he know about it?
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
CRIMINAL
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
So I guess that's it.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Oh yeah.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
I can't help the traffic.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
I'd rather have a knife.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I owe her a call anyway.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
When do we get to drink it?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
It's not even a mile.
Uh-huh.
And she likes Pinot.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Shut up.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
We were supposed to play golf.
I will.  See ya!
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Understanding of what?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Thanks, Jack.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What's happening?
No.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
No way. No way.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
I'm fine. You rest.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
I finished it.
See you.
Try it.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Yeah. Thanks.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Sure.
What about me?
Got it.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Yeah.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
So how're you doing?
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Only for pee or poop.
...I will.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Just make noises then.
I got him.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
Me too.
I'm close.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Me too.
Graham.
Yes.
It's old Morgan.
Who wrote this book?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yeah.
What book!
Yeah... maybe. So long.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I'll be long gone.
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
I expect.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
We didn't get that far.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
I don't have any family any more.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
It's been a while.
It is that.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
What's she got to do with it?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Who's the owner?
That's the good stuff.
What do you mean?
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Please.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
If it's on the page...
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
When is she coming over?
Not quite.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I want you back too, Viktor.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
It was a great show, Dad...
Because obviously she existed, right?
So you did meet her?
Yes, call me Simone.
Is that a problem?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Hello, Hal.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
You want me to call Security?
I was misquoted.
I've seen them all before.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
This week anyhow.
I read.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
She did... didn't she?
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
It's a yacht.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
What do you want -- ?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
I don't understand.
Yes, I'd like that.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Who me?
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
What?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
I don't know.
I don't know, Cole.
Don't fail me.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
Maybe.
Really?
Lots of things.
They scare me too sometimes.
I know.
They used to hang people here.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Who!
S-ssstop that!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Nope.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Tramp.
Bitch.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
No shit.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
I thought you said two hundred.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
He's right. Nice guitar break.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I'll be fine here.
I don't think so.
-- It's not me!
Amends...?
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Yeah?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Let it go.
I said that's enough!
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Why bother?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
Hey, Grant.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Starla, it ain't --
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Shut up.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
How many you need?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
That's disrespectful.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Grant, you're sick!
What other stuff?
Gold--digger, huh?
Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Your what?
Last year, this was a new rig.
What do you think?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
They're both a challenge.
We lost him.
Ciao.
He's after us again!
I would've come back for you.
Like what?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
Yes.
I'll do it.
That's me.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Yeah?
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Redneck heaven.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What does the old Timex say?
I'll believe it when I see it.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
Of course. Yes.
Maybe.
And a very bad gamble.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
And threw us into the lake.
I'm not doing cocaine.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
Then what --
I got his machine.
Look at the collar on that coat...
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
They what? What? No. No. Why?
I thought Heller was a double op?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
I'm here.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Yeah... Sid?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What?
...What are they doin' right now...?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Yes.
He'll let me in.
Who was it?
Shut up.
I wish you'd told me.
No.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
I love her.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Stop it.
Rheya.  Not here.
What do you mean?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Do you?
Gibarian.  He was here.
It's all right.
I can't stay here.
Who are you, then?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
It's an experiment.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
You didn't like him?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
There's a phone in the car.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I got money.
Yeah.
Listen, that was my fault.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
And "is"...?
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I know.
... Don't explain.
So.
I don't know...
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Claire...
Nothing.
I can still use a gun.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
What're you talking about --
I watched TV.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call a cruiser!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Does it make you... hard?
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Lay back, Mack.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Harry…
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He knew.
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Does it have a human name?
I'd never admit that.
I've gotta study.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
So you've found Thorkel?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I will finish what I've begun…
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Just drop me off here.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Looks good outside.
Static!
We'll get some more.
In this barracks?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
And maybe a little something else?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Take it.
Why not?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Which one of you is what?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Twenty-five.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Not you.
It's on me.
What are the chances busting out of here?
What is your number?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Abfuehren!
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
What exactly is he charged with?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Some are not bad at all.
It's a mouse trap.
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
What's the award?
You're teasing me again!
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Let me alone.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You did!
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
What did you say?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Ich weiss alles.
Yes, you do!
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
He is.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Commander.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
You get what?
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
All of us.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Why would you want to leave?
It's our pleasure.
Please, please.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
That's right.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
And what would that be, sir?
Phasing? To where?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
I always do.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No, sir.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Lock phasers and return fire!
Aye, sir.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
What is it?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
David... Sorry I'm late.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Spock's burial robe.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What? What are you saying?
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
What about surface life signs...?
Go, Sulu!
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... Yes...
... The needs of the few...
Success, my lord.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
All true.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
And who am I hiding from?
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
What's the matter -- ?
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
We appear to have plenty of time.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Is that what you came here to say?
Locking phasers on target.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
I shall avenge you --
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Aye, sir.
A few shots, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Try the emergency channels...
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Give the word, Admiral.
Yes, SIR.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Yes.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Be careful, Jim...
Best speed, Scotty...
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
At what.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Aye, sir --
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Where must you go?
Fine. Just fine.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Gillian --
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
It'll come back to him.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Come on, Pavel...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
... My shoes...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
No, <u>my</u> name.
You play games with me and you're through
I'm wery sorry, but --
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We are launching everything we have.
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Just lucky, I guess.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Hm?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
A spaceship with a missing man.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Yes?
I see.
I cannot tell a lie.
How will playing cards help?
The tank will be finished by morning...
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Humpbacked - people.?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
You will be in good hands here.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
... Are you joking?
That's the ticket, laddie.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Tell her I feel fine...
Sulu Hikaru.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
But not you.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Really?
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
From the mission...
How about a passive radiation scan?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
A planet in Federation space...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
The Ba'ku.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Do you know how they were damaged?
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Why not?
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Deck ten.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
You've not aged a day since then?
Ask them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
I'm not letting go of him.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
No children?
But it's comfortable.
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Augh?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
I look forward to reading your report.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Not yet.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Where's the Sphere?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I told you, there's no --
How serious is the damage?
We're crossing the threshold!
Active.
Ready.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Yes.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
You're lying.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
No. It's a lot further than that.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Fire!
Aye, sir.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're still in Earth orbit.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Nothing.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
Admiral Donald...Bill...
You may need assistance, doctor...
We DO sleep lying down.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
We were until your torpedoes!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
They'll make it look like an accident...
I'm not sure how to take that.
How can I trust --
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Your honors, the State rests.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
I know what you mean...
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Where do we come in?
Candidate for what?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Sulu!
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
... is to trust him.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Who else?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
I don't want to.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
I believe I am.
What exactly does that mean?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
No.
No. Can I move now?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Aye, sir... This way.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Fire!
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Emergency force fields are holding.
Do you have a moment, sir?
How could I not?
Make it so.
No!
Understood.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...

Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
What sort of signature?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Aye, sir
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Your new chair, sir.
Thank you, sir...
A coup d'etat?
We can only hope so.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
You know I do.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
We are.
Why are you here?
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
He is what his life has made him!
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Find her again.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
They're holding position.
You don't have to understand.
Silence, Romulan!
I don't want to scare them away.
No, we can handle this.
I don't think so... 
I make maps.
It is beautiful.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
It's in a green Mustang?
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Okay...
Ah no.
What.
Good.
That way.
Pancakes.
What are you doing?
Gas good?
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
You'll see.
I am Jenny Haydn.
I am...
Shit... shit... what shit?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
I need you.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
Go?
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I am your friend.
Why?
That was beautiful.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
I will.
Call the police!!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
What? No, of course not.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Bullshit!
No.
Was there visual contact?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
No.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Just not the eyes.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Fuck you.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Tonight.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Step into my office.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He records himself raping and killing her--
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Okay... what about Strickland?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
That's pretty much the way it happened.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Strickland.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
She still loves me.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
So the guy's not a sicko.
Sure.
Fire's out, isn't it?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
You sure?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
Yeah.  We did.
You really want that on your head?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
This is Agent Mackelway.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot, huh?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
What kind?
Put a BOLO out on that.
Maybe cause he's smart.
What?
What are you doing?
This better be important.
From the grave?
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
"Was?"
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I didn't use Low's name.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
The other reason?
This is some serious shit.
You got a point there.
And one other thing.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Don't be too harsh.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
What's up?
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Yeah, of course.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
How are we going to find him?
Kulok.
Sit back.
The little piggie speaks.
Yes, sir.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
You? You went by the book?
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[What does the file say?]
So you're the new meat?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
The same.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
What's that like?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Nikki.
Why? You're not a real man?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Anything.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
No...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
I would love to see you again sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Yeah?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
What'd you get?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
It's unbelievable.
Go for it, man.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
I didn't make it...
Damned if I know...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Hang on, Voltaire.
I don't know...
When?
I'm not going to Vegas.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
She smiled, baby.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Yes!
No! Not the camera guy!
She thought you were money.
Michelle went for you, right.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah.
...through the kitchen...
What a surprise.
A day.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
They're a finesse team...
You think?
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Six.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Barzini.
Ba Fa Goulle.
How bad will it be?
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
For killing a man.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
And when they shot me father...
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
Thanks Tom.
How will they come at you?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Please say it.
OK. 
Goodbye.
Let HER ask.
Don't ask me.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
How's Mom?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Yes, I promise.
I do renounce them.
Thanks.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Do you recognize my voice?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
It's vile.
No, I like him.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Yes please!
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Say again?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
What?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Ripley's plans.
What?
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
I love Marge.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Dickie?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Frances?
Sure.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Marge, when did you get here?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Shut up! Shut up!
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
What?
I'll take them both.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
A ragione. A ragione. 
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
I can't later.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
No key, huh?
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
I give up.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Yes?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
I'm leaving.
I mean porno movies.
Thank you, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
Is he Italian?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
A real skunk.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Iris.
You can do it in my mouth.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Physical? Criminal?
Military record?
You would, huh?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
I'm a field agent.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Hi.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Well... where can we go?
Why me?
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
I don't smoke?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Guess I must've learned.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes.
Start with what you knew then.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Well, son, you're home!
But what?
Good to meet you.  Again.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Can't wait.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Did you... did you...
Vultures...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Pete...
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Wish I could say the same thing.
I... I don't believe this.
Why not?
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
It's wrong, Leo.
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
No.
Cat.
Oh.
I thought you...
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
Yes?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Yes.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes.
If you have some, I'd...
I despise it.
How'd you happen to come here?
A trifle.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Because she was afraid.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Then go.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
They're birds!
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
The little Brenner girl.
Try my best.
Yep.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Okay.
Impossible.
Shall I call the doctor?
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Mother?
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
You're doing fine.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I started to say... inside...
No, not exactly.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Yes.
We know what it is, Al.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Are they moulting now?
Ahhh, but I know you.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Famished.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Yes, but...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
I wrote the letter.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Yes.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
What'll it say?
No, I have my things in the car.
I'll get it.
It's an uprising.
Take wing!
Mmm?
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
How about you?
No... wait.  Hold me.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
And he'll talk?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Of course.
Then let's go. Now!
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
I can't believe that.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
It was a woman when we put her in.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
He was a nice horse.
I want it --
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
I come from Lisbon.
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Three years.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye --
No great lady will ever take my place?
You can get out.
You're wrong.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
Who are you?
The scar.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Someone else did it.
Yes I do, I really do.
So you're going to kill him?
It's what Lauren would do.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
He said he'd prove it.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About you.
I don't believe you.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
That was my first question.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
I assure you such power exists.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Professor Barnhardt.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
No -- I'm afraid not.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Why not, Bobby?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I see you for a minute?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
It won't work.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Where is the meeting going to be?
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
That's right.
They would have killed this man?
This one could save your life.
Yeah.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
You gotta drive!
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The Prince of Darkness.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
The meanest!
Why?  They're only noodles.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Okay, okay.
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Did we have a date tonight?
I better get cleaned up, then.
For what.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Mom... please.
Michael!...
Soon.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Must be a circuit breaker.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
Me, too.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Piss off.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Dogs don't eat each other.
Yeah.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Maybe.
Anybody sick?
I don't know who to trust.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Hell no.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
Cut him loose?
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
The dogs?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Then we'll never make it.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
That far?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
Don't let up, Childs!
Move it, Palmer.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Then we go after him.
Hear what?
The journey is part of my work.
Where?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What happened?
But there's nothing here.
Morlocks --
Yes.
Last night.
What?
This way.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I will...
Created?
How?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
No...
I'm a foolish man.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Because...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
I -- what are you?!
What's happening to the moon?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
I mean... well... affection.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
A moonstone.
Got here as soon as I could.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
I've seen it.
Do you know you were humming?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Oh?
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
I'm glad.
Sir...?
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Or mud carriers.
How do you decide?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
It's undamaged?
Mara --
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Do you have it?!
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Tell him to go away --
Imagine that.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
I took a different route.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I suppose so.
We don't know.
Dean Fulton...
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Kalen...
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
For our sake, I hope not.
What about Starks?
That's too bad.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
How?
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
They should just be looking harder.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
No, it hasn't.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
How?
Yeah.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
There're no cars on this street.
It's Sunday.
To the hospital.
Then, where are you going?
Good. How's your mom?
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Where are you going?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure.
Why "of course"?
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
I'll manage.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
In the leg.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Oh, definitely.
What's wrong?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Shut up.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
What the fuck is going on?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Not yet.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
It's nothin' like that.
Maybe.
Why now, Jimmy?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Ready when you are.
Which part?
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Why are you actin' like this?
Give me the keys.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I don't know.  I won't be.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
She thinks he's a pig.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Taking a shower.
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Now what what?
Yeah.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Thelma!
Yes.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You know why.  You already said.
What do you mean?
Eeuww.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Where?!
What are you talkin' about?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
What?
So you admit it?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Yeah, right.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Well... at least now you know.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Hm?
Who?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Thanks.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
You found my car?!
Dumbshit.
Nepal? Have you been?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
That sounds like fun.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Three different guys?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
Your turn?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Harvard?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
What do you mean?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Nice.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
What?
That must make it tough.
Hm?
'That right? Good for you.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Healy.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
No, it's an old football injury.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Just a minute.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hi, Ted.
Thanks.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Toy poodle!
Okay.
Really?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Huh...?
What are you doing?
What --
Where the hell are you?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Then you'll call, right?
We've got bigger problems right now.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Something your father would've come up with.
Then they should speak up.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Still heading for Cuba.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Forget it, Scotty.
Dean Rusk!
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
I know, I know...
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Sioux Indian, right?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You crashed my file?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Thanks, Cooch.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
You're steppin' on sign.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
And...
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
I don't see the connection.
What'd you expect to hear?
Likewise.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Crow Horse, listen --
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
What do you mean?
Sorry.
What?
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
We're going for The Stronghold.
You didn't have another vision...
Move it, Magdelana.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Go ahead, Ray.
Ray. What's your 20?
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Leavenworth a tough joint?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
It's not that.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Yeow!
That's all!
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Um. You.
I'm special.
The what?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
What plane.
It's not suffering anymore.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
It's just as I thought.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
. Yeah!
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
I'm fine.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Not to me.
I sit. I think. I play games.
How does it go?
I was, later.
...Something like that.
Well what?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Well?
Yes sir.
F-14's sir.
Remember one thing.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Okay, okay.
But I have to!
On what?
Who's your pilot?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
I've had enough...for now.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Don't.
Was.
That's because you don't have any women.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Tell me one thing.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Didn't everybody?
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
You think I should quit?!
It's not true.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
But maybe you can change all that.
How'd you find me?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Why not?
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
At Rekall.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You tell me.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Oh, Rekall.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
Come on!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Mmmm.....
But I'm always home by morning.
You know I do.
Do what?
All right, forget about it.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
You went to those brain butchers?!
I'm here at Rekall.
Bullshit.
Mars.
What's in the two week package?
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
Hauser left me a note.
Not any more.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I saw them.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
You two-faced-bastard.
The reactor.
It's just up ahead.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
I think I scared it!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Well, who put you two in charge?
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Howdy, Rhonda.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Great.  Thank you.
Sons of bitches!
You got <u>that</u> right!
Me, too.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
No ties.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
God, what a stink!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Around here?  Why would they?
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Sustained.
-- With objection!
Sustained.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
I can describe it.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
No further questions.
No. No...
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I specialize, Roger...
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Chinatown street gang.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
What, the lunatic who --
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
But what?
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
-- Me? Neither.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Screw you too, Kitty.
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
...Okay...
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
No, s-sir.
Don Reynard.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
That's right.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
That's big of you, Bob.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Calls for speculation.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
No? Then what did he say?
-- Every word.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
A woman.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you to kill for me.
You killed Mike.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Was there an argument?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Any friends?
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Thanks.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Shorthand. Really?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's what I heard.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
I'll get my kit.
Faulty wiring.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
WE got it back, that's all.
But Bob isn't real.
What does Bob say?
I already made you two tapes.
Hey, Jacques...
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Not now.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
Hiking?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
I understand.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Mom, take it easy.
It's a school night... back by nine.
A friend from school.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Nothing.
As far as we know, nothing.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Yes.
I...
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
I'm on the staff of...
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Objection.
You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
Yes.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I completely understand...
...I made a reservation at...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I. Yes. It is.
Yes? Galvin, right?
Right. Who called?
...and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm sure you would.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Still looking.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
I think I will.
Maybe what?
You're talking like a drunk.
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Mr. Alito, please.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
He's not in, Sir.
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I can't talk now.
I'm swell.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got to talk.
I don't want a mistrial.
Yes, that's correct.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Can you handle one of these?
It's gone now.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
No.  I thought you had them.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
D.O. to number three..come in.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Welcome to California!
Yes, but...
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
I don't follow.
No biggie, really.
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Absolutely.
Is he all right?
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He was just here!
Everything is not fine!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
What?
I like this story.
Say how they find their way back home.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Coming for you...
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Yep.
I am about this.
Guilty.
I haven't forgotten.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
I didn't know sir.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Okay.
No, I can't.
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Look, I just better go.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Do what?
Jesus, you never told them?
Yes sir.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
They have every right Chuck.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
It has nothing to do with him.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
You do?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
That's enough.
We'll think of something.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Shut up donut.
Trust me donut.  I know.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You know what he is talking about here?
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
It seems we're short on singers.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
What?
I understand.
No.  I didn't.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
We don't have no paper bags.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
No, haven't heard of it.
Sorry to hear it.
Have now.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
No... She's fine. Back home.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
No sir...
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
In many capacities.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
See ya downstairs.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Peanut...
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Yeah?
She got me an abortion...
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
What's that?
So?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Where?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
If you say so.
Fan works.
Love you, too.
You talk to 'im some?...
Uh-huh?
Shake hands with your daddy.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What makes sense, is all.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I asked you not to?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
No.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
No.
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Well?...
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
How are you, Crabtree?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
I thought you were tinkering.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
She left me. Crabs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He heard everything we were saying.
Just go around him.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Competence.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Find the jacket.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
...we find the jacket.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
In a sense.
I peeked.
And your wife left you.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Like the lady herself.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
That's a big book you're writing.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
So where have you been staying?
I don't know...  Me.
No.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Yes, James.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Just checking.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Who does?
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
Caps.
Really? That was fast.
He told me.
Oh?
It didn't come up.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
Her husband.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Why did you come here, Grady?
A jockey? You mean, like --
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
When can I see her?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
It was a beautiful present.
You need a table.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
You don't have to tell me this.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
I mean... feelings.
In that birch tree is a nest.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's a bright sound.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Do you come here often?
Not yet.
It's my bird book.
I have friends.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
Why don't you just tell me?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I could get a search warrant.
You can't talk to me like --
Okay.
What?
They grow outside, don't they?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Yes.
Woodsman?
What?
I was asleep.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
It's a free country, isn't it?
You are in.
Why's that?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Lovers' quarrel?
Can I ask how old you are?
Are you sure?
Ms. Kramer.
What will happen if I do?
Of course.
You think reflection is good.
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
I'm not that crazy.
We have a few more minutes.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Is this the first one?
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
I said I was sorry.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I see my sister.
In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
It was a small house.
Me?
I'm just quiet.
I like the noise.
What about them?
You're still here.
You think I have a problem?
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
Because I like you.
What did you do to them?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
What?
Not ever?
Live together.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
That must be it.
No.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
It's trying to communicate.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Now what?
I don't know, look around.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
I can't... make it... podner.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
He's hallucinating badly.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
More so than the shark?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
How should I be ... arrogant?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
And how do you explain that?
Yes, very much so.
And what about you?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Aren't you going to change?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Better dead.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Unfortunately, no.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
And do you remember where she got off?
From Panarea. Why?
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Lady Patrizia!
You know, I don't love anybody.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Is that far from here?
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Who tells you these things?
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Why?
Yes Mother.
It made them holy.
No.
Oh, there are so many.
At least once a week.
Why should they?
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
I've stopped menstruating
I don't know.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
You'll laugh.
No.
I could never be a mother.
A mistake...
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
I breathed!
Yes.
Yes.
Her headaches.
And then...
No I'm not.
Doctor Livingston.
Because I'm in trouble.
Of what?
Yes.
Yes.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Someone's following me.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you think it's there for?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Go away, I don't want you here.
How did she know about him?
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Sister...
What about Roger? He's free.
When?
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
How do you survive?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
Two packs a day.
Yes.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Obviously there was.
The science of psychiatry.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I don't think I care to know.
I knew that after the fact.
You just said...
Nothing...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
I'd love one.
All right?
Hand rolled.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Of course.
How  ?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Why would I lie?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
The scandal...
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
What they like?
The police station.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
I'll murder that Lennon.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Spoil sport!
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
Come here.
Eh, there's only three of them.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Something like that.
The big hammer?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Parading?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
I'll look after meself.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
He's got you worried, then?
Don't be callous.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Foreign devil ...
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
So's mine.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You needn't bother.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
What?
I'm not, no.
I would have said so.
I knew I could rely on you.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Don't exaggerate.
Don't start. Look.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Sorry.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Someone put it on me.
But...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
A proper Aborigine.
Is that you, Roby?
Yeah, it's you all right.
... I don't know...
I'll see what I can do.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Take a look.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
A voice transmission.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Shit...
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
What?
How's Broussard?
I'm trying.
How many?
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
We can use the flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
What is it?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Let's get moving with this net.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good!  Moisture content?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Yeah... I forgot.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
I'll get you out of there.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Yeah...
Is it dead?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Keep trying!
You win some, you loose some.
I dunno.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
How?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Okay.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Sounds great.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
I... I can't!
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
You should hit the sack, too.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
That's right.
Eddie...
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just like that.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Almost four.
... and Karen.
A dull cliche.
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
No-no-no...
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You're being childish.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
And too many of them are produced.
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
We have that in common.
Amen.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Huh?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Thank you so much.
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I'll try.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I had no idea you were even here.
I don't think that's funny!
Twenty minutes!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Don't mix your metaphors.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I'll say.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
Glory Hallelujah.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
What would you like? Texas?
You know what I'm going to be?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Also Addison deWitt.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
So am I.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
You were just looking around...
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
I don't care if I never get home.
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Of course.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
I'm not crying.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Over my dead body...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Why not?
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
The heave-ho.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
I'm so happy you're happy.
Three or four miles...
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
About what?
Check.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Margo!
That was way back...
Where is she?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
The play? All right, I guess...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Go ahead, please...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
I promise.
Answer my question!
I didn't hear you.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--mine's better--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--fifteen phone calls--
Why didn't we get that?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And I'm a Republican.
--shit--
--has he got an ax?--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
--'cause I only know four chords--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
We're inside the White House now.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
It's nothing personal, though. 
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Hmm?
And you will.  But not now.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
Well of course.
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Just let me get a match.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
My non-denial denial.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
So?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
I have nothing more to say.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
...check...?
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Mitchell knew then.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
The C.I.A.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--well, Sloan--
--go over your sources again--
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
The what to what?
Like what?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Single malt?
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Seduce her.
Why is this?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Forget it.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
You can't sing at the competition.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
But that one time --
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Went home to shit.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
You fuckin' rule!
Dad, come in.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Michelle.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
C-Span?
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
So do I, Kev.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Not for you.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, right here.
Okay.
I want to hear you say it.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Once, in church, dude.
Dude, prom sucks.
Observe.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Uh huh.
Also like sex with my wife.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
Fuck me...
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Andy...
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
Shit!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
When you're older . . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Now just get off the train.
It's the best fork of all
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Yes, you do. You do.
Watch me.
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
Rasputin!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
And tell me that she's happy.
You gave the orders!
Come on.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Who are you?
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Well, why not?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Wisconsin.
Well, where is it? I-
I'll getcha a piece.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
Oh.
M'hm.
U-huh.
Yeah.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Do I love you?
I dunno.
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
It relaxes me.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Are yuh?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Sinatra?
Yeah?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change your wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
No.
Yeah.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's for my complexion.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, I had the radio on.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
I'm cool.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Yeah.
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Why are you so hostile?
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
What are you depressed about?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
Whatta you mean?
You're crazy!
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Look, uh...
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
SO?
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Very well.
It's the way they do things.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Would it make a difference?
One guess.
Absolutely.
And how's the diva doing?
And you've only just met.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
October-ish.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
I'm in mourning.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
To dander.  Otis.
Didn't I say?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
I'd say it was down.
Don't you miss it?
Really?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Anymore.
Sally?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
Nice to meet you.
Hey!  Would you?
I don't think so.
Anytime, sport.
Did you invite them?
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Happy anniversary.
Through the sweats or not?
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Really?
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Well he can't have gone far.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Love?
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't push me away.
You don't have to.
Ah...
Oh, Sally Mae...
Will you make love with me?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Don't be silly.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Very well put.
I will treasure this.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
A lot of cakes.
Come here.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Well...wow...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Yes.
How long ago was it?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Not enough.
Oh great.
You don't know she's a bitch.
Like your business managers?
What does that mean?
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
That's not an answer, is it?
I'll be right out.
Evie has a little something for you.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Divinely?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...no, but --
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Yes?
Oh no...
Mom!
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Duty calls!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Yeah.  How much?
Well, I have some paper towels --
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Oh!
Care to make a small wager?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Good night.
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
You shouldn't.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
I mean -- her apartment.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Over a girl?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
I don't?
Fine. How's your eye?
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
That's very wise.
I'm fine all over.
Shut up and deal!
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Gas?
Yes, sir.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's very flattering.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Yes, sir.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Oh?  Oh!
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Relax, Baxter.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Sir?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
What does he mean, accident?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Now will you get out?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Something like that.
Sure.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Go where?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
It's a thought.
See if they'll what?
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Esprit de corps --
One for all -- all for one --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Sort of.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
We do.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
We're Americans.
What is it?
Too far inland.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
This gentleman or myself ?
What, sir?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
No. Walked.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
You knew him best.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
What?
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
What is this bridge?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why did they attack us?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
I do.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
89   CONTINUED:
107  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
168  CONTINUED:
Your infrared camera?
The radio's on the fritz.
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
It's exactly what you meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Come here...
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
I'm right behind you.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You know Meyerling?
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Shut up!
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
I love you.
Uh-huh.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
I see the help -- judgement call.
His name?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
My son is sick, okay?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Yes.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Thank you.
Two days.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Welcome.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I'll take a bus.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
About a dog.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Well, I can't reach them.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Ask him.
'Love was... '
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
It smells like shit in here?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Got any easier questions?
This stuff is pointless.
Melvin...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Absolutely not.
What's it mean?
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
What restaurant?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?  What's okay?
I ain't scared of you.
You're too late.
Do you want Rath or not?
Sure.
Yes, sir.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
Robert?  Robert?
$1,000,000.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
One hour per man.
Yeah.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Because he is trying to retire me.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
He was killed.
How old were you?
Why not?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
They tried to kill you?
Because I want to know.
Did it ever bother you?
That's fiction.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
What?
Transmits and receives.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Okay.  Then what?
For Nicholai?
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
Jesus, if someone had --
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Why?
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
No.
Honestly?
Why?
Right.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Yes.
A dime.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
No.
American currency.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
What's that? Free!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
We could make a run for it?
He was an electrician?
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Yeah, I'll take some.
They'll never get us.
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
That bad?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
What?
That one?
That's my mum's.
No!
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
How about you Brutus?
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
What?
What? You are crazy!
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Can we charge admission?
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Yo, dobree!
Ah, so what?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
I had it coming from someone.
Cool!
It's Josh's.
No!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
Yeah!
You bastard!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Yes, if you can get him free.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
I'll tell her you were here.
About a job.
Thanks.
Late night.  You?
Yeah.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Landon --
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
I'm just wondering --
York Ave.
Demented.
Scamming's a strong word.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Go for it.
It's private.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
And you have to meet my father.
Don't bother!
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
No.
We're doing something -- ?
What are you talking about?
Loved?
Twice a year.
You planned this --
No. Why? Are you seducible?
I don't care.
Pull over.
Anything you want.
Lower. Same page.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Up to?
No.
I don't want to see her hurt.
No.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I want to come back.
When do I get time for me?
Then you remember more than I do.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
You came here to give me my report card?
Thank you.
No....
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Uh, hi....
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
How are you?
Learn anything?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Run out of gas?
Precisely! 
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
That's just great!
What if you lost your keys?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Jesus!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
Sure,.
I run this place! 
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
What's going on?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Tom...
What's your friend's name?
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Spanish.
Something mi trabajo.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
I don't care.
Yeah.
But it would hurt.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
How's he doing?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
How about over here?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Yes?
Stay as long as you like.
Just thinking.
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
It's mine all right.
Hold it right there.
Then that's it!
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Arachtoid.
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Which?  The one in my throat.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
What DID you mean?
What else?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
Well... actually, no Bill...
Are you all right?
Ever act?
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Well I...
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, I can tell you some stories –
Charlie. How are you.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really –
...Yeah, okay.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Where there's life there's hope.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
What do you mean?
No... no...
No... Can I come in?
We gotta call the police –
Yeah.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I'm at the Earle.
Lou.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Mr. Lipnik.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Nine days – Tuesday –
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
All of which he's now missin'.
Mr. Lipnik, please –
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Thank you.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you quit.
No, Nick, please --
Nilsen.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Are you arresting me?
I don't smoke.
It won't last.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No.  Come in.
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
She wiped out her whole family.
Fine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What's it about?
I'll meet you there.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Of course I knew.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Come over here and tell me no.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
How did it end?
No thank you.
No.
He was murdered.
How's that?
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Cocaine.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Routine.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
You don't like punk rockers?
Why the hell not?
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Yeah.  I know.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
We bring her in for questioning.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
No. Should I have?
I don't know.
Not sure. How was yours?
Let's get out of here.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Yeah, I met her already.
What's wrong?
I don't like beer.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
They're just words.
Not black.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Out?
Use your fucking instinct.
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
About what?
For real?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want some?
You mean babies with you?
A present I picked up for you.
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
You only want one Big Mac?
Me? Why?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Stand still.
Thanks
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Hanging on every word.
We do.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Weird, huh?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Your blood, Max.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
No, just give you a splitting headache.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Coming on line now, sir.
Keep it.
Hey, what's your problem?
What are you talking about?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Well...um...her.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
But he's never said a word-
Dick, don't push me right now.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Where is my wife?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
What do you mean?
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
What did you say?
He ran away?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
What?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
Enigma.
And you are?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Wacko? That a technical term?
What? This isn't normal?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
And now....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
You're a genius.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
... Very good, sir.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
What is it you want?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
No one would miss me.
Finding out where she is.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
WHAT?
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
... Behind the makeup?
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
I said I'd check with you.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Your face smells like a foot.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Isn't it?
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I beg your pardon?
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ahm....
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Sure did.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
No it wasn't!
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Uh... Uh...
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, really.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh...
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Dill-wad...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
I am sitting.
Two hours.
That's how long you were gone.
This is going to take some time.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
What's she doing here?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Who did the sushi?
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Just a hunch.
We're ghosts.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Can you scare them off?
No.  What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
About what?
Are you a spirit too?
I... I don't know what your name is.
Yes.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Let me have it.
Stepmother.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
It wasn't a joke.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
I thought I saw something.
Viridian?
Maybe Charles does.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Their wedding clothes.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
I see.
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
In a day or two, yes.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
No. I like this attic very much.
Your family doctor?
Yes. Thank you.
No. It won't do that.
No. I like it here.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Good night, Eve.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Yes, so do we.
No, thank you.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Thank you.
I have nothing more to say.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Oh, good.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
No, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Hello, Ronald.
I can't read.
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes. Of men and women.
Good day, Sally.
It's very sore.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I am a very serious gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I see...
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
Compensated...?
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Come now, Mr. Chance.
... Hello.
... Oh, really...
Yes, I will.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Do you need a secretary?
Hello, Sophie.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Oh? What?
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Who am I thinking of?
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
I'm a puppeteer.
Right.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Fuck Maxine.
Yes.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Shut up!
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I love you so much.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Schwartz.
Forget it.
Yes?
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're insane.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
No, really.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
I'm right?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
You married?
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
It better be.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Can I be anyone I want?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fork ah did?
Do you?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
He's a selfish bastard.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I will.
May I come in?
I miss her.
Extra?
That was fun.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Go upstairs I said!!
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
She was only-
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Yes sir.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
That is for the urn.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Thank you, Donny.
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
They were Nazis, Dude?
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Lebowski on the right?
Far out.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
And what do you do, sir?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
On you, maybe.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Mmnun.
Uh-huh.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
Hey Walter--
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
No, you're not wrong--
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Dude--
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Is the car out front yours?
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Wha.
Walter--
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
You're a fuck, Walter!
Shit!
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Well we--I don't--
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Someday.
The House of Pain.
Nothing.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Like cancer with a purpose.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
I don't understand.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Either that or feeding the worms.
I don't like it.
Thought you were dead.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Human?
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Look, what's your problem?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
How can you be out here?
You're wrong.
Pass.
"The Blood Tide".
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
And that's a good thing?
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
You get used to the darkness.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Blade --
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
Some. It's been slow --
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
I'm not leaving without you.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
What about the chemistry panel?
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
Perhaps.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
You.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Hey, folklore--
Join the club.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
--my God, Nick???
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
I haven't killed any--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
--fine, later, fine.
Yes.
--Cotter's--
--you should get back into bed.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
I know, I know.
Yeah.
The, uh, blur there.
Both. Now.
No.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Yeah?
Butt-ugly owl.
Too busy eating us?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
--I don't know.
--turn the camera off--
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Enough to keep sane.
I can't!
Ah, Domini?
You planning on sleeping out there?
--and we brought it back with us!
Then I have no idea.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
What?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Does she, goddamnit??
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--it's urgent!
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I couldn't believe it either...
I said you're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
What the hell happened, Ray?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Remy.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
I own the place.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
...Friday?
See, I never knew that.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
How long did you watch her?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Ya catch any fish?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
How would I know?
What.
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
For what?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I'm not sick.
Okay honey.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
You did? A human ear?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
If you want to.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Jeffrey.
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Yes.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
O.K.
. same here.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Go where?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
There ya go.
Am I bothering you?
That's too bad.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Oh yeah?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead!
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
This is it.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Alright.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
You happy, baby?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
I see.  How much?
We want some grass.
We want some grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Barbara and me.  No one else.
For calling you a homo.
Murder.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Allo?
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
I love you too, man.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Oh, I see.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Un sapo?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Yeah, well...
Yeah.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
No.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Out.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
That's right.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
I don't even know your name yet ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Sure ...
It's a question of habit ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
You got something on the coke?
You got something on the Coke?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Did I say it was a natural death?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
How?
Then you can go.
But there's more?
Yes.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Yes.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Back off, John.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
A little after eleven.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Six years.
Yes.
Yes.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
About a year and half ago.
Yes.
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Intense.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- several times.
We stopped seeing each other.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
No further questions.
No.
No.
Yes.
Chinese peony root.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
Yes -- cocaine.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
Yes.
No.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I thought the subject was sex?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
I know.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
It's okay.
You take a lot for granted.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
No -- you're not.
You're a monster.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
You better.  Please answer the question.
He could let you have your vacation.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
What time did you leave?
It's not that long.
SO!
Oh Jesus.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Why are there two deeds here?
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Michael.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Oh, yes.
You want me to call the doctor?
That's it.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
I think so.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No. But I love them just the same.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Wonderful. Uh...
Yeah. See you later.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Sure.
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Because I already tried once.
What?
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
WHY?
What makes it different, Robert?
Yeah. It could get better.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
What's she like?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
So what the hell's the good news?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
That's some terrible shit.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Just try it.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Where we'll always be...
Hush, baby.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Who?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Dad?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Now you.
Shit, that was fast.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Ours!
What we have to do is call the police.
Two point one seventy-six.
Know what?
All right!  Where's the key?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
No!
What are you talking about?
But it could be anywhere.
No.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
You betrayed me!
Sure, Gino, sure.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Why?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Yeah, that's it.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
...  thank you.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
I knew it.
He said you lost something.
What do you want?
Why?
...  yes.
Tell me about it.
Yes, it is.
The redistribution of wealth?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Yeah.
Johnnie?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Yeah.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
He won't.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I won't.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
I'm still here.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
You're asking me a direct question?
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
We have to go home, Jason.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
One moment, sir.
Yes, I'm here...
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Really.
Did you?
Excuse me?
That'd be great.

Oh, Jesus... 
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
Nothing.  It's just not there.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
Where are we?
I can't believe I slept.
Looks familiar?
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Go ahead.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
-- forget it --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!

Think I could rent a scooter?
Not really.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
I tried.
-- we're evacuating the building --
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
...Yer nostril?
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
You remember Alison?
Er, I knew you looked different.
Yes, thanks.
How do you mean?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
You're the only person I can trust.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
It's you ... it's you ...
Don't look back! Act naturally!
No.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It's my fucking life.
I didn't like it.
What?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What parcel?
Suit me?
Well, no system is.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Stop it ... damn you!
Oh God! What have we done?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Information Retrieval.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Emergency procedures.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
But ... I called Central Services.
What?
Are you saying this is illegal?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man, Bucky.
He's working a double shift.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Okay.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
I need to sit down a minute.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
How's he doing?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Frank!
No shit.
What?
You really think so?
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Nice, Jane.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
There are only ten.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Why?
Good night.
Call if you get weird.
Eleven and a half.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Good.
They're not that dumb, after all.
Okay, great -- good luck.
No.
This is important to me.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Sit down, stop.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Wipe me out?
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
No.
What is she shooting?
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Yes?
I spent a fortune on this.
He said something about...
Right there, Bobbie.
No, I don't think so.
Follow me.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
One's enough.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Okay, sweetie.
Honey?...
No.  Not even you.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
I was a lot earlier.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
So great -- right?
How are you at back rubs?
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Billion.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Okay.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Because you're nuts.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
You fucking...
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
Through the closet.
Yes, I'm sorry.
What, right now?
Shh!
Honest?
Oh...
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Here here...
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Just about anything, Walter.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Hm.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I wouldn't give up your day job.
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Don't ask.
Why not?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well I was uh, just looking...
I didn't buy it I made it.
I said I did, didn't I!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Yeah and what would I say?
Put it down, Walter.
Well, w-what did you do?
Yeah?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
Litter, yeah!
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
You didn't like them.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Don't tread on the earth?
Hi, guys.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
Maybe.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You were having a nightmare.
Jealous?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Yeah?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
A dress.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Where?
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
In Virginia.
China.
Lothos.
This is it.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Your turn.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Oh.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
A what?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five.
I can't work this.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
They don't even have Dolby.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Really?
I don't understand.
Got that.
Okay, what else?
Jeffrey!
Well, I hope so.
Nee sitch.  No way.
Like we don't have rights too?
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I am.
Run.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
It's all the same thing.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
it's okay..
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
You're pulling your hips out.
Let me.
Aren't we all?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
What's so great about baseball?
No.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
I can do that, too.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Never heard of 'em.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me!
You're a cocksucker!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
What?
Annie's a smart lady.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
My right.
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
You too...Meat.
Crash, shut the door.
I ain't hitting a man first.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Can I give you my testimony?
...and one helluva guy.
Jim looking for somebody.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
What?
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Philip, if you would rise.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
All right, take care.
Speeding?
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Lester...
Right back.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Somethin', huh?
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
You mean, I have your permission?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
No.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Meet me at three.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
What are you -
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
You never - ?
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
What is it?
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
I - I - I...
I'm not crying. 
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What do you mean?
I gotta tell ya...
What's it...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Get out of here!
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
Mm.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
I should have -
You understand? What? Let you go?
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Not gonna let me in?
Oh, you are...
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
That's amazing.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
A record of the arrests...
Can't do it with both hands?
What?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Mm.
You shut up.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
I can't.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
He's gone?
I'm over here now.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Mm.
Mm.
Want me to take this for you? 
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
Oh, come on.
It's all right.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
I'll be there.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I did what you told me to.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
What about my money?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I love you.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
It means I got the money.
Lester - he called you here.
Here.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
No, I'm gonna drive.
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
Why?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
It's up to you.
Go fuck yourself.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
All right, all right. But I - I -
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
It's okay. Let her go.
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
In women?
Guilty. I am.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Wha-at?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Even the skylight?
What about "climbing in?"
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
I got her...
Now he'll be up all night...
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
And...your point?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
Stop.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
Enough.
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
What?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
This is one way.
Don't you have children?
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
I'm going to level with you officer.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Not this minute.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You don't understand.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
You won't disconnect.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
A woman?
Pictures.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Lucky for them they didn't.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Yes.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Do you have to point that?
You wouldn't --
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
259-7881.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Why are we stopping?
Naturally.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Keep talking.
There are no guarantees in this life.
We don't see you.
Stay there.
It's your call.
Just relax.
Talk to the man.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I won't let 'em.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Call me "Nels."
There's two police cars now.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I thought you'd know me by now.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
How do you know?
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Is that good or bad?
Thanks.
She's not a girl, Col --
Did he?
An excellent quality.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
It's him, isn't it?
Fucking mad!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Like treacle.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
Yes, thank you.
Must be.
How special?
Yes, please.
Shouldn't I go?
Like you're concerned.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I have to talk to her, Col --
Give it over, Dil --
Do you care, Jimmy?
Shut up.
Make it up to me, then.
Probably.
Absolutely.
Don't be cruel.
Not at all, honey.
Afraid so.
Sorry. What you doing?
I'm going home!
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
No! I'm going home...
You knew my Jody?
Did you hear me?
No.
Let them come then.
I like you, Dil --
More what?
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Fergus.
Will I see you again?
Fergus.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Do you want some food?
He's all right.
He's hot.
Leave me alone, Jude.
I know.
Yes.
You know what. Go.
I take pride in my work.
I told him.
And do you know why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Peter.
Should blow you away, you know that?
A hotel?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Right.
No fucking way.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
I didn't even fancy her.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
What the fuck were you doing here?
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I don't know her.
Stop it --
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Who gives a fuck.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Can you remember anything at all?
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
I'm through listening to you!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
I heard you, I heard you.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
No thanks.
We? You mean you're --?
Agent.
So that was it.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
But I don't have it.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Describe him.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Me? Why me?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Open it.
The view had better be worth it.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
That's the idea.
I'll take that.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
There must be some way.
Which one are you?
Come here.
There, you said it.
You did.
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
No.
What -- like Scobie?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Shut the door!
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Fiction or non-fiction?
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
How much is it worth?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Not unless we're blind.
Meaning what?
Leave me alone -- !
Stop it!
But his mother --
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Leave?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
I'm Regina Lampert.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Now you're angry.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Charles is.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I don't know where to go.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
How about once more around the park?
Good night.
Be careful, Peter.
That's all.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
The man you had the fight with.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I don't understa--
Va jouer, mon ange.
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
How can you tell?
The American Embassy.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
He took care of Charlie for us.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
No.
Daddy you scared me!
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I want you to head right home after school.
Run!
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No?
Who's?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Who?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
What?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Did Sharon say no?
I'll think about it.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
You didn't believe her?
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
And she didn't?
No.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Oh...
Freezer in the back.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.


He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
 No.
...-tana.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
Would you hurry up, please?
I'm gonna stomp your a--
...all the time.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Okay, okay! 
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
You're nuts, goin' back there!


Okay.
Well, then, that means it's call...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
...we can make it.
Oh, shit.
Goddamn!
...Pete!  Come on.
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old...
You okay?
 ...shit!
 Shit. 
 Go, go.
Come on.
Okay.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.
...man!

What?
Okay.  Okay.

You're fucked, man.
...-tion?
You know what I'm sayin'?
We were nationally  ranked.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
You all right?
Are you all right?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Go, go, go! 

...on!
...-ful?!
Forty-five seven!
...they come!
...here comes the...
I'm gonna kill him.
What?
It's working.
 There's gotta be...
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Why'd you stay behind?!
Who had to put a gun to your head?
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Oh, my God.
Hey!

Mason, you have to take this...
We do need your truck.
...-lem too?
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You'll kill us all!
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
Went away? 
Forget about him.
Pleasant surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...here!
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - DAY.
Radio the bikes.
...quick in and out.
...-ther orders?
Get your links set up!
...here!
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...-fall.
 But...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
...dangerous.
...Long.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
You got thirty minutes.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Kabula's out.
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
Uh-huh.
...try this one out some-...
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
Doc!
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
 ...or it'll ignite. 
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Yeah, yeah...
...Mason?
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
Do you recognize this young man?
...there's a colonel...

I'll lead 'em out.
All right, go.

...-damn phone.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. 
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's right.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Honest?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Just bring your checkbook.
Oh they don't?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I don't know...
You sure this is okay?
I said okay, Jake.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
You're welcome to try. There he is.
I don't.
What pictures?
And why's that?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
I guess not.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Of course.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Oh... thank you.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
No, not for that one.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Of course I'm sure.
No, I think I'd remember.
Is that unusual?
Why?
Yeah.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Your eye.
Just... I have to.
He owns it. You know?
Aren't you coming back with me?
...That's not what I meant.
Sure.
I want to see her.
What are you saying?
He's in the dark room.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
When did you come in?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Of course.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Help yourself.
I never was.
Never.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
He's not in, Mr.?
He was expecting you?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He owned it.
Yes.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
But that's what you told your wife.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Why'd she run away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Fifty lire... 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Come in, Alfredo.
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Who?
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
OK...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
Thais.
I didn't see that.
Two cents.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
You know why?  She was so -
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

Ask them to sit down.
We've got a nice plant here.
Has he said when he'll finish?
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
What's the matter with you?
Hmm!
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You're no Venus de Milo.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
What're you going to do, Charlie?
Yes?
I'd like that.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Charlie!
Go ahead.
I'll get you some coffee.
Brad, you are drunk.
Why is she leaving me?
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
What do you mean by that?
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
That's the train with all the lights.
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What about that apartment?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
Rosebud?
Am I sure about what?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Can I watch?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
You two better quit it.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
There's more, isn't there?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Let me take you out tonight.
Sang.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Um... okay.
It wasn't me.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
We did.
Excuse me?
In a second!
I can pass!
I'll assess all I want!
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
So I'm told.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Why are the shutters closed?
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Go open the sore.
Did you tell Veronica?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half?
What do you mean?
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
That's frightening.
What about Veronica?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
All right, Vader's boss...
And the second time around...?
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
The milkmaids?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Can you believe this?!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
You know what pisses me off the most?
Sorry.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Yeah, right.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Yeah, but at what a price.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
You want to rent a movie.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Five hundred dollars.
Because I'm here.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Fuck you.
Could be.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave her out of this.
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Same time. What about you?
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Yes.
Thirty-fire.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
With you? I don't think so.
Nothing personal.
It's not my store.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Meaning?
Actually, that's his night job.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
She called you, didn't she?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Something wrong?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
That's because I never had sex with him!
Please calm down.
Dante...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Sure.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
I don't want Caitlin...
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
No way!
That's tight. Solid.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Which one?
Twenty bucks.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Bye. 
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Where's the radio?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Look, I know--
Give him the money.
Okay--I don't know about this.
Sure you can.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Why are you yelling?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
How'd you get up here?
Excuse me?
You attacked me.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Yeah?
Breathtaking.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
Jess, c'mon...
Don't let me fall!
I don't know.  I don't know.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
I burned it.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
No, he's gone.
Sue me.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
There, what's that place?
Kill him when he gets down.
Then go fetch.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Good morning, Walt.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
I've been cured.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Of course. Food alright?
Try the wine!
And you, sir?
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
How do you do, sir?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
I did, sir.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Well, how are you then?
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You wanna be sick?
Fair hair, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
We're going to friends now, sir.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Yes.
Good. I'm glad
Yes!!!
You're not cured yet, my boy.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
What?
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
You psychic?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You're kidding me.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Of course.
Then let's have it.
Can't say that I do.
Can you finish on schedule?
Very generous.
I don't know...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
What's your name?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
What's he sayin'?
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Who the hell is this?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max.
You always stutter?
The trunk?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
How?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Yeah.
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
You mind?  I'm working here.
Leave me alone.
Don't start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
Why?
Why?
Makes two of us.
I don't know.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
One more.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
What'd they do?
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Let her go.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Why the hell not?
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Motive?
For what?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Thanks.
This way.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Because he believed me.
You do?
Without a love of my own.
I can't promise you anything.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
That's great.  Good for you.
Could you be a little more specific?
<u>Liza</u>!
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Well, I don't know if --
I'm leaning toward no.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Yes, that's right.
You do recognize it then?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Working.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
-- Understood.
I was just thinking that.
What do you mean?
Where do you think Jerry is?
What do you suggest?
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Tell me.
You're --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
David --
Are you threatening me?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
This... seemed best.
Well --
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
No primer.
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Is that your official response?
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
But what do I say?
That's my scientist.
The librarian... or the library...?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
Any luck on the grant money?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Actually --
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
It's really happening.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
The final countdown.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
What is it?
But --
Git your shovel and git to work.
I'll make it a dollar.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Yeah.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I... I... I...
Yes, Boss.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
You jes' watch us!
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
'Bout two hours left.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
I just always did like truck rides.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Take it easy, Drag.
You just said he could eat anything.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Kick a buck.
Well, how far didya get?
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
What pattern was that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You get me out first.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
You come and visit.
Who was the man in the basement?
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's no surprise.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Yes.  I have to go...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Oh, I know.
Just horseshit luck.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
What about her arms?
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Right.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
You got a suspect...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
And her husband? What was he?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
It is?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
You're not envious?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'd like to go back. James...
James.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Please, Letty.
I'd have to see it on.
Do you think I should?
That's thanks to all your help.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I know.    I know.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
It's good exercise, Mom.
I've already made arrangements.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Green spot.
Anything interesting.
Paul.
Very romantic setting.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Exactly.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
No way.
Tell the doctor.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Home free.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
No, I need some serious household advice.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I'll see you tonight.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess so.
And all the plans we have.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I don't feel like going to work today.
You can get out of the dinner.
Can you loan me a 20?
I'm going to the store.
That's a big question.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
I love him.
Oh.
I start on Monday.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Sure, I understand.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'll float you.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Where did they go?
It's Elvis...
Good.   I'm good.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Cops?
You want Zero to kill him?
And the Vodka.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Do I?
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
Can I trust you, Sami?
You haven't answered my question.
What do you want now?
Man, I can get anything.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
You can use my car.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
We've got to get out of here.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Relax. It will be fine.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Yeah, I can see that.
It's my idea.
The hell it is.
How?
I know where she went.
Watch this.
Oh, you think?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
I don't know.
Thanks.
Something like that.
The lucky ones.
No.
Stick around and find out.
A little?
I do as I please.
What's it to you?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
You're too young to understand.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
My comb!
Give it back.
I will.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I left the training early.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
We must avenge mother!
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
No further.  I'm serious.
You don't say.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
It's only a flesh wound.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
In a better place.  I hope.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Another jolly nickname?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Yes.
Go away.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
The night is young.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
On my mother's life.
Junior.
No.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
It's not really important.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Thank you.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
It's my house.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
How was your date?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
Why are you doing this?
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Get off me.
Hi.
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Do you want to learn or not?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
I don't know.
You'd do that for me?
I... I don't think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
No.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I swear.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
I know.
I know.
I do.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
You do?
Yummy.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Who is this?
No.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Ronald?
It's Kathryn.
Racist piece of shit.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Even there?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
What's your plan of attack?
I hate it too.
Have you succeeded in your task?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
It was... Fantastic.
Mock, mock, mock.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Well done.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Get out!
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
That's beautiful.
It's Cecile.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Do you know where she is?
Annette! Annette!
It's really important.
We played backgammon?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Sometimes.
I got my wish anyway.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me --
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
I live right here.
It's true.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Because she is my friend.
But...
But there's no one here, darling.
I don't know yet.
No.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Don't cry, Amy.
Yes, Amy.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Why hasn't he got a head?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Anybody could know that song.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Can we get some service here?
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
No, it was another woman.
What else is there?
What does that have to do with me?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Anything's better than Mark.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
People notice you Frida.
Maybe he's just shy.
I don't know.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
And my bra finally fits again.
My vision got worse again.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
No they're not.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Why not? There's been a murder.
What? Why'd you do that?
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
I could smell another woman on him.
You should have seen it erect.
Peter keeps asking me out.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
So you're Grant's secretary?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
You never say that.
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn't a good time.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Your desk.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, but thanks for the warning.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They do? Oh no...
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Thanks.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
Tell her I'm eating.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
You're some catch Lloyd.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
I told you she was innocent.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
The other one?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
How could you have been so stupid?
Iím sorry...
Shut-up.
Who?
What?
No...  No doctor...
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
I'm nothing then.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Mild stroke?
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
Are you out of your mind?
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
This is undeclared income.
So what do we do?
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Extend things?
I don't think so.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
What?
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Perceptual?
Why?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
No.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
No... They don't kid.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Uh...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
I don't understand.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Home.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
You have a lot of secrets.
I know.
It was inspirational.
I can't.
What?
I know.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
We're working on it.
We're doing our best, sir.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Gasparilla?
That sounds like a curse to me.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
What you wanna do?
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox Overstreet.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
At Chet Danburry's house.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
So much the better.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I'm sorry.  I, we
I told you, that's a secret.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
What?
But...
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
All right.  I'll second that.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Then come with me.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Dead Poets honor.
My Word
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
I didn't know you taught.
YAWP!
AHHHHHH!
A madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Don't stop!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
You have another choice.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I'm calling her!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Yes sir.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Yes sir.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I'll take him over mine.
I... I just don't want to come.
I don't want to read.
From my father and Nolan.
Quiet.  I have to think.
It's my birthday.
I'll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
Then you better start swimming.
Shut up!
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
The thieves.
What are you people talking about?
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Anti social?
On the side!!
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
No...
So?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Me??
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Poolside?
Nowhere...
Hey! Come out here!
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
I know...
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit.
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Well... you remember Cynthia?
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Jesus!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
But you must come in.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
I came to see Merle.
Yeah.
Oh. Fine.
No.
Naw.
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Inside, Vince.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Biederman!
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Oh... You know...
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
From Nam?
Pow.
From Nam?
It's ahead, Vince.
What are you, God?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What else?
What do you mean?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
That's my plan.
What?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Phantom Mary?
Yeah!
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Wade's here.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
I'll be alright.
I'm not voting for you.
And I want Doucet.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
How do I look?
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Doucet killed my partner.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
Drop it.
Thanks.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
How ya feeling?
Not too good.
I'm here.
...Have you been drinking?
No you don't.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What's your name?
Good to know you, Willy.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Thank you, Belle --
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
I did not, Grandma.
Sure am.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
No, you're not.
But what becomes of our souls?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Look here now--
I don't care.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
I'm through with you.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Yes -- at midnight.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Coming.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Jabez ...
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
Oh -- Jabez.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Isn't that your own fault?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
I don't know, Jabez.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Jabez!
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Let him try it.
I guess we won't.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
I won't forget.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
I object.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
No, sir.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Tell me about it.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
Okay.
Who are you, then?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
Put it down now.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Sure.  Follow me.
Thanks...partner.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
You don't want to know.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Yessir.
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Yeah.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Hello, Sonny.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  So how are you?
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
You're really crazy.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I like that... yeah!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Look... who's on the phone?
Do you still want the operation?
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
They're okay.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
What do you want?
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
I'm sorry.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
What about Howard?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
You're serious!
Fuck him - let him out!
Get 'em in the vault!
How'd that happen?
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Does that still go?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Sonny - Here's your document.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I said you were never a faggot.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

He used to date Pat Benatar!
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
<i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i>
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
Do you know where Danang is?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
In theory.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
She went up to her room.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Yes?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
You a troublemaker?
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
What?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
You're welcome.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up!
I'm working.
See ya around.
What are you so worked up about?
I'm getting paid...
Yeah, me too.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Don't worry about it.
What is?
That's my name.
It's a motherfucking shame.
What?
I got no say over people.
Run it then.
Tonight, when we close.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Quit bullshitting.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
You keep it.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
I work too, but I still make time.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Trust me.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Meda.  Meda.
Tina, it's not like that.
Later.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.

Ya like him, huh?
On the rebound.
HATE!
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
You listening to me?
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Don't start on me today.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
Ooh gross.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I'm fine.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Is that what I think it is?
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Will not.
Shut up!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Sucks for you.
Shut up!
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
I bet you want your head scratched.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
And with that complete loser
Right.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Oh, you're good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Me too. I'm almost there.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
He passed away three years ago.
You know I do!
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Or maybe crossing a river!
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And...?
Who's there?
What?
Just like the President.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Nothing.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Excellent!
Pain.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Stop him, Jessica!
SILENCE!
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
It's a pleasure...
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
So how'd we do?
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Eddie, how was I?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
What do you mean?
This is kind of a stream--
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Isn't he?
What?
Better than not getting a job?
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
I understand you just moved here?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Tor!
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
There's still a sex-change --
I don't think he's a schmuck.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh, hi.
I am.  How's your father?
Not good...
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Well you tried --
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Yes?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Lines around the block.
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Isn't that the same thing?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Come on...
Al!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Excuse me.
Cool.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Right.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Mm.
Oh my God!!
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
Oh God. What hospital?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
No.
She left.
Welcome to work, Ed.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Okay ...
I missed you.
Oh yeah.
I really like you too...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Shari...
Really? 
So?
Are you all right?
...yeah?
No. It's your fault.
What do we have to do?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
What?
What?
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Please!
Yeah.
I know.
Cassie...
Me?!
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hi.
Ed... I'm sorry.
Do you still have it?
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Sure.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Ed?
That's the point -- this could change things.
pierde.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Thank you.
Here, get down.
Yeah, just --
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Yes, I do.
I know.
Hey, that's super
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
You bet.
As far as I know, they--
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Looks like today's your lucky day
Uh-huh.
That sounds good.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Take as much room as you want
You'll be fine.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
I did it.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Oh.
Still clear?
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Okay, let's say
I also like bananas.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I know.
What do you mean?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Till 19-fucking-70.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
It's not what you think.
Yes.  But do you know?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
I'm not sure.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
How?
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Of course...
I got her address.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Clean?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
His blood's always up.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
Okay.  I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Just don't shoot me.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Of his penis, sir?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
What's her name?
Not good enough.
Why?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Where'd you hear that?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
Something like that.
And no one'll know about this?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Nothing.
Who are you calling?!
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
You're not.
Listen to me--
When can you get it here?
Rachel Banks?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
You're crazy.
Yeah.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
We said a hundred.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Who?
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
You sure?
No he won't.
No.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
How fast can you learn?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Law enforcement?
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Is that good?
Okay.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
No, sir.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Just for the criminals.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Something bad happened tonight.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
How could you let me find out like this?
I know.
I see her for business.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
Was that doctored-up, too?
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Just reporters.
That's okay.
That's gonna end tonight.
Sir?
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Brill.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Who's doing this?
For the last four years.
Bullshit.
How?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
I <u>did</u> care how.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We'd rather not--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Where's Stacy?
Really?
Dad!
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
What about jewelry?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Christ!
Why would they--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
To the cops?
Jerry?
Yeah.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Fuck you.
We found the originals.
He's clever. He had help.
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
Do you have visual?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
No.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Her or me?
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
Good.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Don't go over it again, please.
What?
Would you let me pass?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
A surprise, he said.
What?
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Appropriate?
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
I told you so.
Okay.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I don't know what that means.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Very true!
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Oh really?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Because I'm a nurse.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Yes?
Your friend?
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
K is for Katharine.
Thank you.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Of course.  When?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
I'm feeling old.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What's he saying?
Why?  Are you German?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Bingo.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Why didn't I think of that?
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Then don't.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
You can't.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Can you follow simple directions?
Look on the back. What do you see?
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Good morning.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No. It's a down payment.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Let's just see how we do.
Little celebration before we set off.
In eye of that painting.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Duh.
The Mask.
What?
Yes. Yes.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
I'd taken the Mask?
Transfer.
Where the money is.
A parting gift from the Empire.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Feeling old?
It was wrong to deceive you.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
No way.
Get out of here!
I'm not leaving without you.
What about you?
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
This is big enough.
We're supposed to.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
So you say.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yes?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Right.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
Five million dollars.
Yup.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
Course I did.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
I know how DNA works, Erin --
And that's what caused the contamination?
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Erin --
How do you know that?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Nope.  Maiden.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Ten?
How?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
What do you mean?
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I didn't say that.
Keep your voice down.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
That is not what I'm --
Thinking.
I can't leave my job, George.
I need it.
Mm-hm.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Uh-huh?
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Come in, Admiral.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
I can help them!
And that is why I must go.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Now you're making sense.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Where?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Can you trust him?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
No hard feelings?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Not really.
You're part of the mining guild then?
We have no use for your kind.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
I understand.
Closer?!
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Oh my, no!
Let's go.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Han's leaving?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
You are reckless!
I thought I was in good shape.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
Never.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I want that ship.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They suggested oranges.
They're...pretending to dress.
We know that.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Somebody get off!
Having second thoughts?
No.
Lock fuel rods.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
I'm here.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
You're running out of time.
Thank God.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
What's this, what's this?!
...of course...
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
Love demands it.
He has given up.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
People make you laugh?
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Oh great, anything else?
What didn't he tell you?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
You're a nice man.
What!
Fine thank you.
And those lies she's been telling?
You're kidding! Like what?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
The priest.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
What else?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
He's nice.
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
Why does God let us get tired?
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
St. Mike's.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Stealing is a sin.
Sure.
Who's in it?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Intensely.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
How's your leg?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
I once did a paper on it
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
That's to bad.
Come on!
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Fuck him!!!
It's our goddamn car!
Little slow tonight.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
They're falling out.
How many?
How will he eat?
Oh.
Go fuck yourself.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
Two nights.
How we doing?
What's the point?
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Huh?
Jack...
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
What do you mean?
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
What?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Yeah, fine.
You recognized me.
So what do you think?
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, you take the right.
Good idea.
Yeah.  You mind?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Because I can hear it.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
What the hell are these?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
How come I didn't hear anything?
February?
You always threw up.
The tenth's out.
I can't make the tenth.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I don't know.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
What're you doing?
Later.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Yeah.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
Just call me a cab.
Blanche.
Right.
This is where the auditions were.
My watch is broken, too.
Don't take it personally.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
What's he talking about?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Hey!
Time for what?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Hey!
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Virgins.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Yeah.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Huh?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Forget it.
Huh?
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
I'll call you.
Yeah.
He leads, I follow.
Pretty much.
I suppose.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
I guess in case one year they're not.
In and out.
Nothing.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Soap?
He called her.
Nervous?
Oh.
I've given it up.
If I see him.
Losing his teeth.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Eddie did.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Merry Christmas.
Huh? Oh, no.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Drive.
My place.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
It's important.
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Not if I kill you first ...
Pollux is -- what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Janie?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
What?
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
You?  Married?
Excuse me?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
What about me?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
I think I could figure it out.
Five thirty.  Okay.
That’s where you work.
Like what?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Great room...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
It’s me, Jack...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
What?!
Please.  Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
C’mon, Jack...
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Get out, I call 911.
How’d you do this year, Tony?
You hear me complaining about that?
Yeah...fine.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Do what?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
What...?
No, open it...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
Are you sure?
And now...?
That’s a big one for me, too.
It’s wonderful...
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
It’s like a museum.
What are you talking about, Jack?
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Jesus, Jack...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
I've got plenty of places to go.
Merry Christmas...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Relax, it's casual.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Victor's better at these things.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Got it, teach.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Is it safe?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
Oh, it is.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
So are you!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
And if he's not...?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Hilarious.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
It's been changed.
Great minds think alike.
Yes, thanks.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
And reverse the mutations --
You <u>were</u>?
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
And take a little trip with them...
As part of the Crew.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Yes?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
You can't --it's too dangerous --
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Yes...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
No, there's no other way.
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Send the following message...
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Where we going?
Go ahead.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
I could use a lawnmower...
Looks simple to operate.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What?
Whoa, Daddy.
We split that.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Oh, geez.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
...The heck d'ya mean?
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, he's adorable.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Uh-huh.
Chaska.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Oh, yah?
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man!
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah, right -
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Ya kiddin'!
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Huh? Yah?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
No. No, ma'am.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Sir? Right now?
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
My patience is at an end.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, okay.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Mm.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Call 'em up.
Nope.
Yah.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Aw, Norm.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Just a Diet Coke.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Anyone else residing there?
Yah, is this Marge?
What'd he say?
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
- looking.
Still missing. We're looking.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Love ya, Margie.
Yah?
Thanks, hon.
Oh, fine.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Right, right.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
We're still men.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
What does that mean?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Sure.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
The girl had done her homework.
You haven't been going to yours.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
What... ?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Whatever.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
Answer the question!
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Oh, yeah.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
My suitcase was vibrating?
Now, find your power animal.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
No, supply oxygen?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
A hotel?
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Is it?
My dad.  No question.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Any historical figure.
Good answer.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
He was obviously able to handle it.
No.  Not at all.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
Uh... nah...
Look at your hand.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
No, I'm not...
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Imagine how he feels.
I want to know --
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
... is over.
I don't know!  Tell me!
What... what are you saying?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
You... you can't be serious about this.
I'm going to...
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
I think this is about where we came in.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Why are you doing this?!
You told me you'd say that.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Why?
Too much school.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
We need to hurry.
Random, sure.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
That lucky bastard.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Yeah, so what happened?
...My Premonition was just like his.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
I know.  I can feel it too.
No, I'm good.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I know, Dad.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
I'm... really sorry.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Thirty-nine.
Most kids never have it happen.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Easy, Billy, just open it.
I don't.
Look, there's something you should all know.
Why do you think I was hiding?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
No one's that strong.
No.
Star Wars?
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Exactly.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Nguyen is good boy.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I couldn't get you in.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
What's the plan?
We just take pictures?
About 22 hours on site.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Well did you or didn't you?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
I was attacked.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
He just needs some clothes?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
My agent.  I called my agent.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
It was a crime.
Fine.
No, I have to work.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Great place huh?
My name is Parry.
Sshhhh!
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Fifty dollars?
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
So what? You going to help me?
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
What a gyp.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Twinky?
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
You treat me like I was.
I love it.
Is what you?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Okay...
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Palm Apodaca.
How do you know it's clean?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
I didn't get it, did I?
Am I on TV?
Well, you seem very professional...
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
Don't, then.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
What?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Wait...
Yeah, me, too...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
What?
Bye, Robert.
I guess you fell in the water.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
At being a fake.
I'm fine.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Just give me a chance, will you?
You're all full of shit!
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
It is true.
Jesus, what a rude person...
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
That's an old maid's tale.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Yes.
Look at me.
Then don't go out with me.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Nothin'.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You got a boyfriend?
You look good.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Wussup, Victor.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
I can't man, I'm punished!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Eddie from Compost?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
How old is he?
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
She didn't say she had no man.
Not really.
You're kidding.
I have no idea.
Fletch, this is dumb.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
What'll it be Fletch?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
We play tennis at the club.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
What?
Nothing. They're still there.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
Fletch?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
What's that?
I'm all ears.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Sure.
Deal.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Nothing to it.
You've met her?
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Here, take mine.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Don't tell me I can't --
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Very good, sir.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Sierra del fuego.
Lock's busted.
Moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
You broke it? You know the source?
Frieda's boss.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Who's your decorator?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
But I am...
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Thanks, I needed that.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Johnny's C.D.?
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Ye-ah.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Twelve pack?
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Fine!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Go on, another time, another place.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Fuck me...
What?
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Everything is everything.
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
He is not wrong.
Mmm.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
You're for real?
Names.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Willie Mays.
Strike out, eh?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
How'd I know he had a knife.
He coulda been white.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Whatta you got?
What is that old building?
I been damn careful up to now.
You know what I'm saying.
So what?
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Elvis has left the building.
Well, why not a little of the King?
Did he?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you more.
Okay...
I'm serious.
Luck, my ass.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Wait...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Huh?
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I lost you.
Fire.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
I'm glad.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Something happened, something...
I don't know...  What about the other women?
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Yeah, I think so...
No.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
John, he's got my driver's license.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
What's wrong?
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
She's pretty special.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Where's Shelly?
I don't know...
I love you, man!
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
This is all the exercise I need...
Will you come with me?
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Is that so bad?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Sort of.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
It was nothing.
I have to.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Great.  Just great.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
I wish it was.
Happy Friday the 13th.
'Cause it stinks.
Why?
Are they grown-ups?
Yeah, we're here.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
There's no time for this bullshit...
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's what I'd like to know.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Her name's Stephanie.
I'm now begging you.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
She did!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Never.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
It's...dead.
Nothing.
Walking corpses are not real!
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
You're telling a lie.
She didn't push me into coming.
But Sean said...
Just felt a little chill.
I gathered that.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
But I didn't get you one...
Where are they?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Very big.
What did you find?
Very bad today.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Do we care?
I say we go.
Here we go.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
About what?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
A flat-out hit.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
What's sexy?
Two-all after six.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
All right. What's been going on?
How prominent?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is real.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
They're only gonna lose.
Oh yeah?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
Because God loves a winner.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
hat was this morning.
How come?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Sidney.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
What color?
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
A little.
Alla puttanesca.
I don't know.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
I'm going home to my machine.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
I'm sorry.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
I thought you were a man of God.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
"Hell!"
We must end the campaign.
I hope not.
A great deal.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
No.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It's over.
It's for the best.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
Now is your chance to find out.
It would be five thousand more.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Where do we start?
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Where did you get this?
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Again?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Any particular reason?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
You may as well invite her here.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
How long?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
In case you get back before I do.
I'm travelling too.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
How do I square the accident?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
I was at home.
Why would we do that?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
You'll be next.
What exactly is wrong?
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
Get it over with...
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
I'm still here, Doc.
Really.
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
There are three men dead.
Do it my way.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
She's on TV.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
El Paso.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
I don't see how.
You and me.
I'll be ready.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Who was it?
Where do we go from here?
Pull over.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Where?
Wire pull over?
I'm good at that.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just fine.
'Bout five thousand.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
This is my brother's car.
Why?
Christ, what...
Jack...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
No, do you really?
Really?
So where are we going, Princess?
You've been watching the film.
I don't know.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
No.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Right.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
How'd you find me?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Pension him off.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What's that supposed to mean?
Not much.
And that'll make me feel better?
How could I stay away?
It would be. If they were still living.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Making a living.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Shut up.
Knock it off, Gerald.
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Ha.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
I had to.
I...I don't know.
They killed the goose.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
Some contest board...
...cower in his boots...
I heard that they were running cold.
Himself?
What?
What hard part?
Huh.
You...
Men come work for you...
What?
What do you mean?
Huh.
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Yes.
What did you say?
We are?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Did you talk to Graff?
For five thousand?
I...
Yes.  I'm sure.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Is that what I just said?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Because you listened.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
It's a waste of time.
What?
To the cops?
No.
Where was I?
You think so?
Where did Moss...?  I...
You understand?
You...
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery. 
That they're going to be upset.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
The leads come in, I'll let...
Go to lunch, George.
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Excuse me, sir...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Levene!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Get in the goddamn room.
Shelly, you blew the last...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Now.  Yes...When?
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
Somebody broke in.
The leads are coming.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
What are you talking about?
You're so full of shit.
That was easy, wasn't it?
Uh-huh?
Mmm.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
You sold eight Mountain View?
They took the phones...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Go ahead.
Me.
Mm.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
If we wait till Mon...
Tell me again.  Your wife.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
It's nothing.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
You did?
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
I got lots of presents.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I can't.
To do business.
That's right.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Connie.
Michael...
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
No.
The children can stay.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
He will grow strong.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
And you believed that story.
I've always taken care of you.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Beautiful.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Why?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Am I a prisoner?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
I don't know.
Sure, Mikey.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Mike, at three and a half...
It was a boy.
Did my brother go back?
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I don't think that's necessary.
Very well.
The witness is excused; take him out.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Michael.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
No, I'm fine.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Let him gamble.
No.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
I do not.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Turnbull is a good man.
Keep them alive.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
The same assurance we got from you.
What about Michael Corleone?
What was that?
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Tea is fine.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
He is dead now, twenty years.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
What do I do?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
What's to sketch?
But why?
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
No.  I could have, though.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
You were a soldier?
I'm game.  Sure.
Do I look okay?
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Run for what?
Good.  Let's get dry.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
What'd you say?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Oh Clayton.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Yes.  Perfectly.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Luminal.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
A visitor.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
What rumors might those be?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Of course.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
What kind of job... ?
Jesus ...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yes ... Kip ...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
You know my back -
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go --
You know my back.
A little family emergency --
No...
Kip.
I don't think so, Detective ...
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
The other day....
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hey, Donny --
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
Dignity...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
We don't -- ?
Remember who my brother is?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Of course ...
Yes, sir -
You've been pre-booked...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
What do you say, Toby?,
Yeah... You want a ride...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Don't go there, Toby --
I dunno ...
Yeah ...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
About what?
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Sure, man --
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
Run it...
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Six or seven...
That what you want?
Okay.
No ...
Oh. Okay. Right.
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
I bet you say that to all the girls...
How is he -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
What's that?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
She left...
Who's "Eleanor?"
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really --
Not --
Excuse me --
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Nods again.
I understand.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
You treated me like shit.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
I'm in construction.
How much?
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her carry this shit inside.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I can't make any more deliveries.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
That's important.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
All right, then.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Gone.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Yeah, it is.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
Yah, all right...
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
That's one aspect of what we do.
Somethin's in my room.
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Yeah, can I help you?
Hey fuck you.
What're those?
An integer.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Yes.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
I need someone with your kind of background.
I'll be okay.
I won't talk first.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Now wait a minute--
--I'm not angry at you--
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Sounds good.
He was my roommate in college.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Like what, Will?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Have you read all these books, Will?
What did you think?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
You think so?
285.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Time's up.
I don't know.
Hence, the word remarried.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
No, I don't.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
You're kiddin' me.
What?
I didn't ask for this.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
You're not going to fail me are you?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
What?
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
So you just want to use me and go?
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Pretty boring, I guess.
You know, nothing special.
Well...
No.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Some, a little.
I guess so.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
And you're sure about that?
I can't go out to California.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
I'm not honest?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don't want to hear that.
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Joe!
How 'bout you?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Naw. They paroled me.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Okay. Go on.
What's it to you?
Sure, but what is this?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Got a warrant?
Joad. Tom Joad.
An' you say no cops?
You got dances too?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
I never heard nothin' about it.
What you figger to do?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I ain't gonna run.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Take her with you!
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
Sure. We aim to.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Okay. I be back a little later.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I'd a found you, Ma.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Ya say we're acrost?
You promised, Tommy.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
They killed Casy first.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
I know that! But *where* they gone?
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
But who done it?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Won't they come out here?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
We gonna take whatever they got.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
I wisht it was day.
Morning.
We can pick anything.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Don't say that.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Then express yourself, Bob.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
I'm a professional killer.
Where have I been?
You see someone?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Bad people.
Unbelievable.
Yes.
Okay... Hold on...
No.
Jesus Christ!
I'll hide.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
One cannot love and kill.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
All of it?
And they want me to make up for it.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Yeah...
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
He sold me this bad boy.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
That's good.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
All by yourself?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I am comfortable.
Why?
Fine!
What about him?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Whatever you want.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
Then why do you want to leave?
Well, one was for salad...
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Tom's gone.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Sing it to me, Frankie!
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Why?!
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
She will if you think she should.
Okay.
Night.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Take your time.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I was there for that shot, actually.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Oh, how sweet.
You!
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
He thought it was a ghost.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I know where he goes.
What does that mean?
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No!
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
NO!
I know. Amazing.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
You ever miss it?
Sometimes.
Don't move!
Hack the Planet!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
It was him, man!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Curtis.
Dead?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Hmmm.
Revenge.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
How did you know that?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Think you can do better?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
If I win, you become my slave.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
I'll hack the Gibson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Yeah.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
I think we've got something.
We caught 'em.
What's happening?
Cancer?
The rabbit is in the administration system.
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Virus?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Congratulations.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Real charmer.
All right.
Don't get angry.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
You don't owe me anything.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
She's not dead!
What does that mean?
Get back!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
I can see this is useless.
How many people in the bus?
Got it Earl.
Like a real sister?
I don't want to.
You bet.
It was the nightmare man
He's coming to get me Rachel.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
I've got you come on, go down.
All right.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Got it Ben.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Huh?
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Fun-ny. See you.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
He was watching me.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Yeah.
Michael's around someplace...
Promise?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Sure.
I don't like that story.
What did he look like?
I'm scared...
No! Do as I say.
Let's make more popcorn.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
What did you use before?
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
What does that mean?
Come in, come in.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
A lot of works.
And then, uh, April...huh?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Oh, okay.
Let's take a look.
Well, are...are they big?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
...cannot go on the air.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Oh, God.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes?
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Everything's okay? 
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Bye.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Poor Hannah.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
No.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Was I?
But, you got four children!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
Always.
No, nothing.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Because he likes you.
Yeah.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
They're in the basement.
I can't take this anymore.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Stop accusing me!
Oh...
You know... 
Hello?
But not you.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Why?
How are you?
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I think we need to eat.
Huh?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
Yeah.
...you know?  I, uh...
Is there no chance?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Yeah.
Well, how about this?
Oh, yeah. 
Oooo.
Singing?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Well-well, like what?
No!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Yeah?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Really?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I am.  You-you made my day.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
...which I did not get.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Take our literature...
I'm going to tell you later....
Some museum director disappeared.
They're offering... 
I have not read you your rights.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...would you excuse me...?
Yeah, so where is he?
Impossible.
You take this much time over everything?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...are you alright, sir...?
Somewhere in Italy.
Have the child taken to bed.
No.  And...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
I can make you rich.
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
...what'm I looking at...?
You nervous...?
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Enchante.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
...who say...?
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
You're <u>free</u>...
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
...not to turn around.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
...what did you want? 
I know it well.
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
When?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Wha-at?  What is it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
You guys have been so colossal...
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
So what?                                                    ]
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yes you do.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Iunno.
Don't worry, you...
It's been known to happen.
Not now, Wendy.
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
You're beautiful.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Something like that. Will you do it?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Uh-huh.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Suicide is a private thing.
Sure.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I didn't. Cherry.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
Next channel, darling.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
You must have had fun.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
What?
I thought I...you..
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
I think so, man.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Get a job.
That's three things.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
frowns at Henry.
Is it hurting, dear?
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
That's enough, Yvonne!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
gives her a sympathetic look.
Mummy!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
That . . .
That idiot boarder?
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Mummy!
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
The way you just looked at me...
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
How much time off?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
What's the difference?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Uh... eighty two?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
What?
It's perfect.
No please make yourself at home.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Try stupid.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Allen?  He... he's okay?
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
That's not what I mean...
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
You're sitting on your ticket.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
What about?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
How are they with kids?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Who doesn't?
Sure.
Isn't that always the way?
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Uh huh.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Bye, Neil!
Uh huh.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Here, take this out to the table.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
What's that?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
What?
What?
Huh?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Fuck you, Philip.
Did you lock the garage door?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
He wasn't there.
Oh, honey.
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
We'll talk in the morning.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Isn't it?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Do you have enough money?
The thermometer's broken.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
-- A man.
Even cosier.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise.
Really.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
So?
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Central Park.
Most people are afraid of death.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Then it's worth the journey.
For what?
I'm sure they will.
Me?  Of course.
What worries you?
No.  What am I to do?
That doesn't matter.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why not?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
You remind me of someone I used to know.
About what?
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I wanted to get to know you better.
No.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Conner?
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
And this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
This cannot be.
I know.
I'll no forget you.
Yes.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
It's happening right now.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Like what?
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Dennis.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Where is it?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whatever.
He said something about a girl --
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Another minute.  Please --
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
I know the one.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Where's the office?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
They're still in the house.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Of course.
I'll be back.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
What did they say?
Satellites?
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
What is it?
Oh my God!
Give me the phone.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
I would never do that.
I will see what I can do.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Please, be quiet.
We must do something.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What about us?
Go out! Where?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
In Ruhengeri?
What?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
There is one thing I need right away.
What's wrong?
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
Yeah...something.
Is she alright?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Did it work?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Up here --
Over here!
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- yeah, we did that --
I'm better than that.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Back where?
We're safe?
For chrissake give me a hand!
It's succeeding!
I don't do groups.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Question answered.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
No, no, it's just --
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
-- my loss --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
I can't comment until I get paid.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
He would have been back by now.
-- ten.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
By killing them?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
I'm ok mommy.
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
He's blessing the house.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
You didn't think much about that before.
Or what she was worth.
Ok.
Were you fooling with the power?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Ok...
I'm ok.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
So what should we do, father?
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And what is ... this frozen moment?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right.  Right!
What is it?
Did you know him?
And he still sits there?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
No.  Really?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Fuck you!
C'mon.  It'll be great.
I laughed, I cried.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Anna, I think you better stay....
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Last rites, sister?
Ooh-kay...
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Never, why do you ask?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
I guess that's a no.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
Alchemy.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Sharp.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
-- or lack thereof?
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Oh Norville, I --
Sez who?
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Huh?! But, buddy --
And Sid says you stole it!
Yes sir...
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Damnit, where's my car!
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Yeah, tell me about it.
She looks in her purse...
...Her mother needs an operation...
Where?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
You don't believe in it?
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Yes.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
You can't really believe that.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Of course not!
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
And charming?
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I imagined this so differently...
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
So maybe you'll come too?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
See for yourself.
You think I --
What do you mean?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Elena.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
The phone's out.
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Good.
Stay out of trouble.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Birth control.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Huh?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
But what?
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Well, we can talk about it.
We were just riding around.
You're not a psycho!
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It's not a bother.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
I gotta get to English class.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You going to tell dad?
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Who said so?
Sure, anything but this English.
Then why'd you come after me?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
With who?
Charles, what time is it?
Yeah? See ya.
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Vodka?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Don't worry about him...
Worth pursuing?
What I saw?
Has her books in it.
First I need a copy of the key.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
That's right.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Will?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Habit.
That's not what he thinks.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
Ran like hell to go to him...
You don't know.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
What was?
Who?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Then so was mine...
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Are you the leader of tis group?
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
She is.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
We can do that?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Stop her Louis!
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
No. Laudanum.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Sit still. It's not finished -
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Not yet.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Yes...
But if she dies...
What do you mean?
I can't do it.
But why do you want me?
Sure...
Do you think so?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Lestat, what do you mean?
CLAUDIA!!!
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
He did it to make you stay with him!
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Yes...
What about a radio?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Who? Who is here?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
No, I'm the King of the World.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Don't even think about it.
Just kidding.
They never found the body.
I've got to see.
Come on, you can make it.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
It's okay.
It's gonna be great.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I don't know.
I'm fine.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
To get out of Southport?
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
It's in my room!
I'll talk real slow.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
How much?
So why are you still here?
How's the water?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
What is up with that weirdo?
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
I think not.
She has never mentioned her family.
I was looking for you.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You wouldn't tell that ——
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Her family name?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I can't understand that.
We have no time for that.
It is for that he hates me.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
All right –– all right.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Don't . . . George?
What did . . .
Suicide.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
It isn't me!
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Yes, but George . . .
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Of course it's the place.
Well, what happened to you?
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Came back three days ago.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Oh, George.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
She was here first.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
You may kiss my hand.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Come on, tell me.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Well, then, sit down.
Don't you like her?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
That does it –– come here.
Hi.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Sure, sure I am.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
You going to the lighthouse?
Well, I don't know....
With butter, if they got any....
So's mine.
I'm supposed to.
Good.  It's terrible.
Yee-hah!
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
The Shark.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
The rope!  The rope!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
No!  It's still there!
Happy to do it.
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Please.  It's my job.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Not till next year.
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
You said something about a camera.
Did you get any pictures?
What else you got?
Me neither.
My ass!
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Is there one in these waters?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Late.
MMMmmmorning....
What're you guys doing today?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Do you?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
Going out.
I know, I know....
Two of them are still missing!
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Shouldn't he be at home?
Hiya yourself.
Shh.  Shhh....
Great.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Who'd you ask?
Shut up.
What's that mean?
What Kids?  Who went out?
Mike?  Our Mike?
I'm going.
Anything?
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Yeah.
Quiet!  Shhh!
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Would you take him?
Brody's riding his tower.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Forget it, he won't listen.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
No.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Honey, I gotta go.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Nothing.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Are you coming...?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No.
No, you're not.
Me, too.
You don't.
What's up?
So tell Calvin.
Well, that's why you got it.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
But you --
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Should be coming out of it soon.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
He's missing.
Someone's looking for you.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
And alone.
No, think of something else.
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Now what's this do?
It's okay, Sean.
I am serious.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Don't you dare.
It's disappeared.
Yeah, poor bastard.
What the hell's there?
Oh...
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Always do.
All right, hit those lights too.
He needs a haircut.
That bugger moves fast.
No way....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
They're at the beach....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I'd be afraid of losing....
We'll be there....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
Stop what?
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
Adds flavor....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
You can stay in my room.
Thank you....
Good night, Daddy....
Mother....
What?
Mom, please don't start that again....
I am.
Trying to write our report....
No.
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
It's wonderful....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
You're always taking time off....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
She said it was coming....
Get her started....
Good news travels fast....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
It needs more time to charge.
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
Put me down....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Forget it....
What?
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
When we got the grant....
We got it together, Jake....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
So far..
As long as he's been here....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I didn't ask you to....
I'm going down, Jake....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
You don't like my voice...?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Mom....
Here it comes....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
I'm training to....
Good night, Polly....
Yeah?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I already did. What's his problem?
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Hey ..
Bits.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
My hands?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Of course I would ..
It was probably the wind.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Have you known her long?
How d'you know what I'm like?
Really? What did he say?
I know.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I don't want them to arrest you.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Two or three years ago.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Ask him.
That's right.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
There is something missing here.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
You're imagining it.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
No no. I knew.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
I just got goosebumps.
Thanks.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
We will be fine!
Sure.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Of course I know --
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Okay.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Huh?
Uh, not today, but --
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
I'm a little worried --
No.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Fine.
Well.  Good luck with that --
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
How sad --
Not a chance.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
You okay?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Dick.
You'll lose.
No.
Funny.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Just drop it Paul!
When did you have it last?
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You mean it?
What about Eric?
Where is it?
DAD!
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I thought you were an expert.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
I don't think so.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
NO!
Really?  What do you do there?
Goodbye, Alan.
Any weapons, radios?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Then we go home?
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Back out! Move!
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
John . . .
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
I want to see the nesting ground!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
I don't even know this woman.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Piss.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Good.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
Oh, God.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
What do you think they want?!
No way.
Where's Kelly?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
They died together?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Say again?
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
What's that?
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
- - shut up.
Hola, bienvenido
In a box under my seat.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Really?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
I doubt it.
"Thunder lizard!"
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You have no idea.
Why?
Machines hate you?
What kind of opinions?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Yes.
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
I really think we should go back...
That's my job.
Fuck you.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
That's open to debate.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
What is it really?
Yes -- that's us.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
Did you?
-- In what sense?
Then its authority is in doubt.
No, I left it in his office.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
-- Listen to me --
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
No, I suppose not.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
Then why haven't I been --
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
You look tired.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Now Ann ...
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Value? ... Value?
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Jack!...  Jack!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Native costume?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Compassion.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
She was with you after she left Frank.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
You think people hate you.
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
So do I.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Could I ask some questions?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
No thanks.
I go on rounds.
What do you think?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
No, I said what did you think.
Well --
Mm.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
What am I supposed to say?
What?
I was wondering what that was.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
With Trina.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
OK.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
It's got to make sense some way.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
It's in the report.
She told me.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I looked it up.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Uh huh...
That's okay.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Oh...
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
See you in the morning light...
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
I do not, your honor, however--
No, I did not.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Objection!
Yes...
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
I...I don't know...
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
I don't know...
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
You want what?!
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Ted, do you love him?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Murray.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Any prospects?
I understand.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
No!
Are you, General?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Time to study.
I miss my brother.
How many?
You could buy them.
I am him.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. Not very big.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Britain?
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
The people will not allow it.
I will not go.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
You will always!
You decide.
Does he have the spot?
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Is that true or pretend?
Pretend.
Ahh.
I will miss you.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
We cannot.
What would you do, Holiness?
It is a difficult situation.
I see that.
Oh, yes.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Cocktail?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
I coulda shot you, you--
No crocodile has ever--
Yup.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Right.
You do?
You talk to Bickerman?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Never been to Maine before?
Who?
I'd be able to see something.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Good.  See ya soon.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Ssssh!
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
You wouldn't?
Likewise.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You too.
I'm fine, thank you.
I can look at dead things.
You talk to the married couple?
Was he swallowed?
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
<u>Apologize</u>?
I asked you to be nice to him.
You like Jack?
What?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
Me too.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
<u>Kelly</u>--
Wild guess.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Liar?
Shitbutt?
Thanks, Ardelia.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Where?
Sometimes.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Thanks.
I think we may be, yes.
Yes sir.
And what is that, sir?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
I think so.
May I see your credentials?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
I didn't.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Then please - do this test for me.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Mmm. And what else...?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Did you breast-feed her?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Why did they turn back?
I'm sorry.
How did you learn English?
Sorry to disappoint you...
Miss.  May I?
Alice?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
There was no letter.
He delivered no such message.
I am sorry, Duncan...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Dark haired...
That is sedition! Treason!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Your enemy...
We'll see in the morning...
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
What else?
That's all, sir.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Fire!!!
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Wampum?
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Be my guest.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Crunch...Implosion.
Just get in yours!
Shit...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
How much time does that give us?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Ahhhh!
I know that.
Beautiful.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Hook's on 24...
Itches like hell.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
Who cares?
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
The infirmary?...
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Your pocket?
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
I still will, if you don't mind.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Well what?
They were . . .
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Jesus Christ!
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Sure is.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
Furry muff, let's go.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
No.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Just give me the keys.
Out the back.
Hit the fuckers.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
What do you mean?
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
I like your bar.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
You know how much it is, Nick.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
That's going on optimism.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Twelve.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
I can't take any more school.
I can fix cars.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I'm sorry, sir.
I am, sir.
You really want to know, sir?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
No, sir. Not at all.
He'll live.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
You're testing me?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Yeah.
He swore by it.  What?
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
What?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
The Trail of Tears.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Dad--
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
You wouldn't?
Cool.
Lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
Pleased to meet you.
Substance abuse?
Appreciate it, sir.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Aqui! [Here!]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We don't need a new jail.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
--Santiago.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
The Perdido thing?
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
The Sheriff.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
He was killed.
That's me.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Of course you can.
It's Saturday.
Enough with the clothes--
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
So I've heard--
We haven't talked since high school.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
More, I hope.
What was your father's name?
Couple months before I was born--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
You'd do a good job.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
You know who it was?
Been away. Up to Houston.
Yeah.  It's French.
doorway) And who's that?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Deep shit?
He's a priest?
What is he?
Yes...
He's with us... He's with us...
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
You haven't seen anything yet.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
And they all came...
Yes.
Good.  There.  Yes?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Somebody killed him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
So could you walk on water?
Oh, I've got plenty.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Are you a gambling man?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Probably.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
A ticket home,
I'm afraid she's not in.
Shut up!
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
What about?
A Mister Quaid?
I won't say anything.
Yeah.  You could say that.
Not much.
Yes...
For what?
Well... nobody.
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
He deserved it.
I did it for Dorothea.
It's me betrayed him.
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
Yes.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
No.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
What about Philip Swann?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
And he's dead?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Why would I want to?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Ok.
I know. I don't either.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
No, you smiled.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
No, yes, it does...
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
How old is she?
Fuck off.
Working.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Yes.
What are you talking about?
Alright?
Do you want to- 
That's ok.
Bye.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
What?
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Do you think they have a room here?
Sushi.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I don't know.  What are they?
What time did you make it for?
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
You heard voices, you know you did.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Just open the door, please.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Peter Kelson?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
Peter, please...
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
What's the...OH SHIT!
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
We're going to do this.
Terrific.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Get out of here.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
How is he?
To that stewardess?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
You're cold?
Huh?
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Why not?
He's in college?
Yeah, right.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
Too many times.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I was just playing ball.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
I wouldn't know.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
Your legs don't look broke.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Would you watch the damn road?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Yeah.
You either.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
Quit.
What?
Right here.
You're not stupid.
Why not?
What's up?
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I never asked you to choose.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Uh huh.
What do you mean?
A rest?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Keep your voice down.
Nona, please.
Uh, your earring?
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You know, people.
What mess?
I mean, it's not true, is it?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
We need to talk.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
In my sleep, Burt.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
What's wrong?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
GET OUT.
I'm coming!
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Did you hear what I said?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Good bye.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
I've got troubles.
What?
-- no.
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
I'm a rapper.
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
What's up?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
Might of been before my time.
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Yes I do.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Who?
Twelve.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Go ahead and waste your time.
And that's what you've heard?
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Around here.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
He passed away.
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
I'm really sorry.
Mmm.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
Are you lyin' to me?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Are you alright?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Love you too..
It'll take the pain away.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
Yeah.
Well maybe.
I'm not through asking my questions.
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Are you her boyfriend?
Yes.  What's your name?
You're her boyfriend?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
Like what?
What's MOW?
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
Should be one-thirty.
Love you too.
You're late, not me.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
I didn't know the answer --
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Go to bed.
Hi.
It's ok.
It's not right.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
M'lady...?
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
To the Bastille.  And death.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
You can't do it.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
It is also a place of burial.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
What use am I?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on...
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I know.
The King killed my son!
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
How did you know -- ?
She will be at the ball.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
It's lovely.  It's just...
I... we are humble people...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
So what?
You mean shut your ass down!
Alright, stay on the phone.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Did you start out area six?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
It wasn't in the cards.
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah?
What did you do then?
Yeah.
Please...
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
OK...where do you want to start?
How about Marvosa and the others?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Then what did you do, play canasta?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
Could he handle a direct contact?
Christ!
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
See? You do know something about him.
What is it?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
When I'm done.
You wanna watch this or what?!
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Tonic will be fine.
Uh-huh.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
The Tooth...
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
Was I in an accident?
I don't want to know.
Yes.
I'm very scared.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me.
Yes.
God, no.
No.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Dr. Chilton.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Uh... sure...
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Most people are.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What did he want?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
You got a deal...
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
...after a while.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You're insane.
Yes.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
You got it.
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
Those are my terms.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Yeah...
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I'll take my chances!!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
So your name's not Gorsky.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
I used to think you were original.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
He said he's coming back!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
They're gonna lynch him!
It's my name.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Hurry!
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
What?
Two grand.
If you get caught using that --
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
The Matrix isn't real!
What are you doing?
... Yeah.
What happened to them?
I got you.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.
... Yes.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What does that mean?
Far from it.
Wild, isn't it?
Show me.
Your mind makes it real.
I think I do.
She would say she knows enough.
Yes.
Do it!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I'm not the One.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
How do you know that name?
What is the Matrix?
That's different.
Yes.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
What choice?
I believe I can bring him back.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Yeah?
What do they want?
I'll be all right.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
I can't!
Look fella...this is private...
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Uh...can we give you a check?
Be careful.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'And with your spirit.'
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
And say what?
Thanks for the ride.
Panther!  Same thing...
Not quite...but keep trying.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Should I slap him?
There won't be any this week.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Don't be smart.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
No.
Good idea.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Fine.
I know.
Stripper?
Yes, you did.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What did he do?
What was it?
Well...
It's all right.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Well...no.
Sure.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
No.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Of course.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
It's for the party, Dad --
Do they, m'dear?
Yes, it is.
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
As close as a deal could be.
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
How nice for you both.
I don't care.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Joe, you do get around.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yes.
You loved back?
Hi, Jennifer.
What?
As long as it takes.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Then why are you here, Joe?
I don't know.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Girlfriend?
I said get out.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
How beautiful.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
I love you in an evening gown.
'Love will find out the way'.
It's a saying.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Thank you.
No.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
I won't.
Good night to you, Bill.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Yes?
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
I don't understand.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don't know.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
I'm her father!
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Not at all.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
I don't expect you to.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
I am not a dream.
What?
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Good morning, Quince.
How's that, Quince?
Thank you, Quince.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
You think Drew will go for it?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Does Drew tell you everything?
I am.  With you.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
You're not listening --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
You and 'Honey'?
I'm sorry --
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
Why not?
But we've got time.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I have no memory.
As requested.
When was I in here?
Yeah?
That's right I did, didn't I?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Thanks.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't say anything else.
Strip!
So you have information for me?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Don't remember.
Did you?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Where is he?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
Calls himself Dodd.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
About your whore of a wife?
Who's your boyfriend?
So why did you come here?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
You're in a playful mood.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Probably left it in your room.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
From who?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Why are you following me?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
Somehow, I'll know!
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Why would I have a gun?
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Lemon or lime?
Doing...?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Okay.  You got the "item"?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
And what is that?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Later!  Do you dance?
Died in childbirth, having me...
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
'Cause she will tell you.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Nothing.
Five minutes...
No.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
We're makin' moves on each other.
Chill out Sonny.
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's the point?  It's going down.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Where's Riccardo?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Yes.  What's up?
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Do we need this...?
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
They lied.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
What of?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Uh, yessir.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
... and taxi fare for me.
Where?
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
What?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
About ten kilometers.
Sixty?
Would you recognize him again?
But didn't have heroin.
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Beats working.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Hello.
Billy!  Please!
Where is it?
Yeah!
After we're outside the kogus?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
You know where it is?
I know where it is.
What?
Oh shit.
You can't take anything seriously.
My passport!
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
What's your name?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Shit.
Weird shit...?
Right.
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Nino, please...
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
No, there's...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
It didn't bite me.
Toss the flare down!
How?!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Peter-
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
That's it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
She used a baster.
Oh, Jesus.
What is it?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
What?
Anything you can tell me might help.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Following me?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
My daughter must be going nuts.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
The Sistine Chapel?
Well, I hope you like it.
Yes.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
--cliff-hangers--
I'm telling you, I can't.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
A toast?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
It is.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Be my guest.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
You're still a writer.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Great.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
All done, chief..
Not possible..
Oh, I am.  Later..
'Thief in the Night?'
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
To do what?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Not for seven more minutes.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
How much longer before you can reach him?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Indeed.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Listen to what?
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Like?
You were there.
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
That simple, huh?
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
She must still be on the property.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
By asking me.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Always.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Take off your God damn coat!
You're sure about this?
You don't think we're going to make it.
Is this the only way?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
One hour.
Why was there another team?
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Certainly Ethan.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
About what?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
That depends.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I wouldn't dream of it.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
We're not outta here yet.
I didn't touch it.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Jim we canít.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Very well.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Can you lose him?
I remember..
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Of course I can hear you.
Jack...that's spying.
And a lonely ass.
Twenty minutes.
I always check the batteries.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Why you drinking so much?
What?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
No. You were there.
Ti amo.
Again?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Hurry up.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Let me come and talk to you.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Loretta.
He knew my husband who died.
Bus hit him.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Me neither.
Don't just become excited.
You ruined my life.
I'm in love with you!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Awful?
I think that's it.
I know what I know.
Yeah.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
No.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Is Johnny here?
Johnny.
Maybe you're right.
Never is a long time.
Alright.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Who is he?
You have a brother?
Sure.
How was your plane ride?
If I marry you my mother will die.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Everything's different.
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Did you see it?
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I don't know.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Johnny...
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I'm a housewife.
Why do men chase women?
I think it's because they fear death.
Yes.
No.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Marriage is happy news.
What? What?
Is who down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Did you dress her up like this?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
What do you mean?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
You don't vote for kings.
And not too expensive.
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
'Tis but a scratch.
I've had worse.
Come on then.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Bedevere, my Liege.
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
There.
Who did we lose?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Bloody peasant! 
Course it's a good idea.
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
I'm getting better!
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your name?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
I'm ... your son ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Leaving the room.
What?
Camelot ...
We'll cover your escape!
No.  It's unhealthy.
Please ... we are doctors.
You've come to rescue me?
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I've got my duties to attend to.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You know nothing about her!
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I see.
Whom you address.
Out of my way!
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
And that is my last word on the matter.
My own.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
Back and upper corridors.
Who'll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Aye, do.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
There are important papers from --
I am a blank sheet.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Quite.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
I don't think about it.
I wouldn't know.
Maybe, once.
Why?
See what?
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
To keep out the cold.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Yes.
To know when he'll be king.
No, she wasn't.
No, indeed.
A few days, ma'am.
Why?
No.  I shall be out walking.
Again?
What is it?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
He?
How'd you know it was us?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
I came from the city on the left.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
It's twelve-thirty!
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
Sure.
What?!
It's already out.
I don't know.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
No I'm not...
What are you going to do?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
There never is.
Well, it's a long story...
In this world, wrong is right!
You have no time.
Who fired everyone?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You gotta be kidding?
There is no problem.
Yeah.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
One.
Okay.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
I was afraid of that.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Yes.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Not that I can see.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
I'm all right.
What is it? What do you see?!
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
I just wanted to come here.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Find out who they are?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
No time. Get him up.
We wait. This is an elevator.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
Fine...
Let's go.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Yes.
Girder, watch your head.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I don't help criminals.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Ow...
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't have to tell me twice.
What ? Are you my mother ?
When will that be ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
What do you mean sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
John, sir.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Better, sir.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
No I am not.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
You're paying the bills.
Do you want to go out with me ?
Yahoo !!!!!
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Oh, just put it over there.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I would do it again in a minute.
What about giving the other guy a break.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Me, I'll know!
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
I'm leaving Sunday.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well you know what I mean.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Great.
Her favorite poet.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Totally groovy huh?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
How about a nice glass of milk?
I was pushing as fast as I could.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You mean, you knew about me?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I won't.
No THANKS!
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Just give it to me!!
DON'T!!!
Big deal.
What do you think?
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
For the mini-bike fund.
Was Rose.
Yes, it does.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
This is it I guess.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Not exactly.
She'll be all right baby.
Bye Niece, Vada.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Hey! Oh look.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
WHAT?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Yes.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Yes they are.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Did she ever see Vada?
Is there enough room?
Yes.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Perfect.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Then who's it for?
What?
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
He was allergic to bees.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Will you tell her I came by?
Thank you. Bye.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
Do you think she is?
Why do you think she says that?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
I am.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Thomas?
Can I use your bathroom first?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Come here, sit down.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Oh great!!
Yes!!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Oh no!  UUH.
I'm trying.
Uh huh.
What?
Yes.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I am not.
What?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
No.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Kindred spirits.
We're about to find out.
I can see why.
You like her.
And you believe that.
That was Thursday.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
And what will he do?
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Don't you see...
... unless he has a hump.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need you.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Such as.
Endearingly absent-minded.
She finds him "personable."
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Till the gas ran out.
What, leaving school...
I never eat when I'm serene.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Like I said, dazzling.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
It's more than that.
Me either.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
It means a lot.
... maybe it's congratulations.
Well, it happens.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
Like family, huh?
To him.
What is that sup...
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
You're much more his type.
Right here.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Hi! Star.
I won first prize.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
You're so good.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Bye, Bye.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
He knows better.
How is that?
They can come to the concert in the park.
Third party?
Okay.
Whose?
Minimum.
Sure thing.
When is it?
To the bathroom.
What crook?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
She's in Paris.
I'll just be in here.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
Suits me.
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
No.
Sixty-three.
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Linnea?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Hello.
You're real favorites of his.
What!
Out.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Oh?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Did it break?
How long have you been together?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
What?
Where is she?
No, we never did that
Where are you from?
I'll be dammed.
I see.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
That's what Tim said.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
How's it goin'?
What?
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Yes, sir.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
She sings? What does she sing?
I'm keen with anticipation.
All right, Mickey.
Don't worry about it.
Let's do it.
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
When have they ever been right?
Out front.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Got it.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
NO!!!
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
No fuckin' way!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
That's the way of the world.
Capt'n!
Where do the air ducts lead?
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
How 'bout Mallory?
Slate it.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Really?
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
All right, you get out of here, man!
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Where was that?
Where's Wilma?
Where's he at?
Okay.
No. I'm new in town.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
What d'you expect?
No thanks.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
'Been up north?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Well, what d'you think?
Yeah?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
You jivin' me?
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
What d'you mean?
'Round town.
Like what?
'Got a good thing, man.
'Bye, Jocko.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
That's right.
No, they won't.
I guess not.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
That'll make the folks very happy.
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Since when?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
I'd say you were full of shit.
Dixie McCoy
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
It's Case. Remember me?
Yeah. That was me.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Nobody has.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
How's the ice?
Case.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Couple of months.
Almost two days.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
Case...
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
What is it?
You're out of time, man.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
What are you talking about?
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Leave.
If you say so.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Yeah.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos, that's not what we're --

No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Kristen got a quote?
Have you been to any parties?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
Dude, you rock!
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
But I'm not a penguin.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Do you remember high school?
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Yes, desperately.
Really?
I-
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
You like her?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Oh I don't think so.
Thank you.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You remember that story?
I know.
To put us back together again when we fall.
Oh--yikes!
Well, are you here with anybody?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Why?
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Yeah. Definitely.
We went through the door...
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
For this.
I know.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Can't you make other creations?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Specifically.
Maybe he doesn't know...
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
It's not the gas, Dad!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
How come?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah.
I know.
Wow...
I don't know.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
I'll get over it.
Oh, Jesse...
You okay?
No.  I'm okay.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I thought I'd wait for you.
He's full of shit.
They're healing up nicely.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
It's an amazing gift.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Never been here before?
Sorry.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Anything?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
Mary Helena.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Cooling down.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Uh, fourteen.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Well, they can be.
Fifteen million dollars.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Here, let me help.
No thanks.
Really, no.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Oh -- Okay.
And what happens next in the dream?
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
She saw through me.
You've got to go.
Come in.
This is the place.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Oh no no -- no.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Well, get a message through to him too.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Okay.
Who was Gilda?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
Okay.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I haven't decided.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
What?
Shame!
And we intend to use them!
Working with Leonardo.
Di Caprio.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Still, not sparkling.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
The others?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Definitely no comment.
I think you do, yes.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I believe I have.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
No, no.  She doesn't.
What are the choices?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Hi...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Two?  That's it?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Yes.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
Yes, that is correct.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
I was in luh-love with her.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
No! No! No!
Mister McMurphy!
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Right!
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
B-B-Billy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Go ahead! Go back!
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
What for?
Atta boy, Cheswick!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Me, too...
A pecking party?
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What for?
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
Just warmin' up.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
No!
I don't trust you!
Hit me.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Hold it a minute.
A nickel.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
What is it?
Hold it!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
In what way?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
'Kay!
How much ya wanna bet?
Sure...
Yeah, what's up?
'Kay...
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
No...
Oh, yeah...
Hi.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Tha's your problem.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Take you han's offa me!
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
I thought so.
Oh, yeah...
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
No.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Oh no.  Do you?
Except possibly that.
What's mezzaluna?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Amazing.
Non.  Please.
Hm.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Yes.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Who says I don't love him?...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
You too.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Yeah.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
I know the feeling.
Well.  Congratulations.
GET OUT!!
What?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Yes.
I brought you that, too.
Well, not exactly...
Yes?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
I don't know, Kate.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
I know...  It was.
I think he's having an affair.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Maybe.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Only what?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Nothing.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Packing.
A little bad luck?
What?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
No one's perfect, Kate.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
I'd love to.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
That's really romantic.
Ten billion to one.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
Sure we keep records!
Gimme.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Then don't.
That was the idea.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
Thicker than water.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I know. I know.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Hello, Edie.
Tommy, what happened?
I'll get home all right now.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
I only live up there and across the roof.
The things that go on.
Oh she's a beauty.
Hit me again, Mac.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
What for?
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Go ahead, wear it.
You?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
Terry...?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Who is he, Pop?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
What do you want from me, Father.
What about it?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I'm just resting my feet.
You'll work.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
I told you lay off.
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Forty-five bills.
So-so, Johnny.
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Now just a minute, I—
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Go on, beat it!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Where?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Don't let them hear you.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
What can we do against them?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
You know better than that.
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Who is it?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Tell me, how do you do that?
He'd call every once in a while.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Till they got busted.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Shit.
Two hours.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yes, she did.
Yeah, I did.
I don't know.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Half for doing what?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Jack --
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
And what happened to Carl?
You're gonna use a ram?
The manager's door is metal.
I could walk out of here.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
I don't smoke.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Sure.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
You'd probably tell me.
Shit...
Who was it answered the phone?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
She did, huh.
He killed a police officer.
I don't think we should get into that.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I see better with them on.
In the trunk?
I don't know...
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
You gonna write me a check?
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
I remember you now.  Shit.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
How you know that?
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
You not with probation, one of those?
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Then they're not separated, are they?
What'd I say?
Off a tip?
Not at all.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
It's possible.  Why?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I told you, he isn't here.
I don't have any idea.
Like a fag.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Well, I need that...
Still...
Where the fuck is Foley?
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
You mean hiding them?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
He was that good?
Red...Strange?
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I was grieving too.
So what are you saying?
Come on!
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
Home of the Brave.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
You were more like brothers.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Y-Yes Sir.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Bombers.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
You too, 'Mam.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
God help them.
Learn English, then!
Crank her!
Peggy Sue!
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
That's disgusting!
Don't say that...
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Why wait?
I thought it had a lot of merit.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Let's go down to the basement.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I just can't trust you anymore.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
How'd you know about that?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Of course.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
What, why?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Don't you get along with your parents?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
Can we split now?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Doing some shopping?
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
What do you mean?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
You have an incredible memory.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
I	know what a burrito is.
Am I dead or not?
Richard, take it easy.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Pretty much so.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
Yes... why?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It's been a few years.
Sure.
It sucked.
I'm going out, Dad!
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Zowie.
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I'm not burying him here...
What did?
What do you mean?
Go later...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
What's that on your forehead, pal?
I am relaxed.
One hour!
Close the law book.
No.
Maybe you should think about it.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
More than your friend. Family.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Funny.
Little baby girl.
Continue.
Continue.
Makeup.
They sabotaged me.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
What's her name?
Rayisha. Very nice.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Let's find you a drink.
Sure. It's fine.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Do you... pray?
You're ready, don't worry.
I suppose you could say that.
I still am.
No. I didn't.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
You bet. We'll see you later.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Yes.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
That's right.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Right.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Second.
Aren't you?
Give me the camera, Joe.
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Night, honey.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Charles...
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Look deeper.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<u>Listen</u>.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Don't do this to me....
I know what's in here!
Possibly.
Hey, who?
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
I assume he licked it clean.
How many?
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
For your own fear.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
You know who Muhammad was?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
I would rather we all stay--
And what about the cells?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Looks clear.
No. She's not.
Not if I'm the one.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
Do you have any weapons?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
No.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
But how long is a day?
That way.
None at all.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Huh?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What signal?
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
long pause) You know it.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
What?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
With one of them.
What about it?
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
I don't know.
Okay.Up to the cave.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Which one?
Taylor, please --
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
This is his assertion.
He doesn't know.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
Dawn...
...don't feel like it either.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
...there's nobody.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Thank you.
I'm supposing.
How do you do?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Immigration Officer?
I see.
I see.
What did you say his name was?
As I said before...
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Whatever you say.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Bad enough.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Just who are you, anyway?
I'm different. I like it fine.
I didn't notice him.
Couldn't be.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
You leave it.
That, and the fun of it.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Yes.
You were there when I last saw him.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
What does he see?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I know that.
Sometimes.
Goodbye, Betty.
Who's Goble?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
I don't.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
That must hurt.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
He saw my face too.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
With what motive?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
So it seems Sergeant.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Should be over there.
Pretty big chance, huh?
So?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Oh nothing.
Positive?
How about Magruder?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Who's the girl?
Nice.
Why should I mind?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
Years, why?
In an hour, Larry.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
He was delightful.
Yes.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Thank you.
And to history.
That's her.
And you're at this third stage
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
I have to be up early. 
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
That'll be fun
No jokes.  James is in love.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
Take a look at these.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
That's good.
No, thanks Dad.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Where?
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
You do it... you first!
You first!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Sir?
I take the skin off chicken.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
What are you talking about?
Tyler, put the gun down.
Who cares!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
What do you mean?
No way, old buddy.
This gets better by the minute.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
We're not going.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Right behind you.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
Thank you, Sergeant.
What's that, General?
Hawkins?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Who indeed...
You're making the right decision, sir.
Sit... and spin.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
I never joke about money.
Fine.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
What?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Why?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Mmm, I could tell.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I got a dress, yeah.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Any good?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
He's good at what he does.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Huh?
Did you?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
My what?
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We just did.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
I'm up.
Give me twenty minutes.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit!  Where've you been?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
What?
But I always eat like this.
I like steak.
Steak spoon! 
Professionally?
'Scume me.
I just might do that.
I think it's great.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
What? -- go on --
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
-- well, when does it get good?
Because I can stop now if you want.
You want me to read this or not?
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
As you wish...
My spy network has heard no such news.
Of course.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Light him.
-- power too -- promise me that --
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Thank you.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Then why are you smiling?
Get used to disappointment.
You're sure nobody's following us?
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
You know what a hurry we're in.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
Hmm.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Australia.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Ooooooops.
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Do the books!  Do the books!
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Where?  What?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Aaaaaaaaaa!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Right.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
Only if we ask him.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
We can't play today?
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Vat?
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Send for Goebbels.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Of which morning?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Back where?
She isn't still here, is she?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Must've needed it.
Sam, if she's here...
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
All right.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
With the forty thousand dollars?
Like what?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
May I talk to you?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Don't you know?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What do you know about it?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
I hate tears. 
Yes.
She'll need both of us.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Sam.
Well?
Does that mean we can't...
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I haven't even been married once yet!
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Please... I'd like to go...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Maybe you saw Mary!
Arbogast.
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Do what?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Did I?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
You--a friend to me?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Maybe you're right.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Yes!
A voice ...
I don't agree with you.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Well, I do say it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
At any time. You will always be welcome.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
What do you think I am?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Horsefeathers!
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
Excuse me???
Yes....
That's the physicist's playground.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
You won't die, Rose.
Okay.
What are you going to do, Rose?
How did the rabbits kill him?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I don't know.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Boy! Wow!
Is that all?
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
What time is it?
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
Who?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Oh, anywhere downtown.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Yes, sir.
Well, it's Billy.
You mean a farm?
I don't believe it.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, I remember it.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
You can stop it right now.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
What... ?
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Stop blaming yourself.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
What?
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
No, but it should.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
There'll be other chances.
You going rogue on me?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
You can't be serious.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
It's our job.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Dead.
Sounds good.
Just got here.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
Beholden to none.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Yeah.
All right. Stand by.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Who are you?
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
His lightsaber.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I don't know.
Lando!
Lower it!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Quiet.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
For you.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I didn't make him for you
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
...I'm sorry.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, I do.
I should leave.
-- The legs.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Yeah...
I gotta go out for a while.
What're we going to do?
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
Christ.
Paulie!
Don't talk like that to him!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
...Stop jivin'!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Does that bum have to say that?
No wine.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
...Fine.
Do I have to pay juice?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
...Thanks.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
...Yeah.
I like yella teeth.
Maybe I like garbage.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
I got pain an' experience too.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Damn! How's it look?
What?
...Adrian ain't sharp.
...Sure.
Ice skate.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Gazzo's a good man.
Whatta you think?
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
...People talk to me more.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
A tweeting bird?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Maroon, right?
Ask her...
They?
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
That's right, me.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
I don't work in Toontown.
I've already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
No, I don't.
Take it easy.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Yeah, that's better.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Uh? Uh?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Romeo will answer it?
Why, what is Tybalt?
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Good-morrow, cousin.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
But 'tis no wit to go.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Ahhh!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Well, what was yours?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Right.
I am for you.
Is that right?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Which leads us to...
That's why you were riding with him.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Not yet...
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Is that right?
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
You first, Edvard.
I take it you still want the money...
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
A post office box.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
That's it.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
How did you know?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Call it a reckoning of character.
You seem one to me.
Why don't you go do better, then...
My way is better.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Yes.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
I'll work on it...
Finish the job...
You better get some sleep, alright?
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
You slept with the fucker!!
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I can't get enough of it.
Sure thing, and --
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
All right we will.
That's not what I mean.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
There it is...now what about the others?
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
He killed her...
None of us like it!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
No.  Why?
You mean that guy was an agent?
What's that?
Has he?
I love you too.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
Great...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you Sally.
I don't know.  My friends...
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
What are you getting at?
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Is this marked money, or what?
Lingerie...
Well I just uh, you know...
Hmmm...
Sure.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Then what the hell are you all about?
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
At least around here it does.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
No, I just assumed...
How much is that?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
What??  Where'd you hear that?
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
So what's your story?
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
This won't take long.
I am a tourist.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
I'm okay, you go.
Ask me if I give a shit.
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
What did you say?
What?
What is it?
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
No mu-shu.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
It's worth it to me.
The Plaza Hotel?
Some Kung-Pao?
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
Now you know.
Baby Duck?
It's my responsibility.
This is still Hong Kong.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Sir, I can explain.
Carter.
This is pathetic.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
Witnesses.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
I know a shortcut.
Stool pigeon.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
Yee-aww.
No, fish is a PM food.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
The Feds?!
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
It's called a dress.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
What are you talking about?
Carter, can I have a moment?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Maintain eye contact.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
His hair... any color.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
You're coming here?
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
And you defending her?
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
No, I'm not.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
You have one?
We'll see.
Without oxygen...
Highly suspect.
You don't know.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Excuse me?
Yes.
You humiliated me!
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
I love you, too.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
She's the boss.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Why?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
No.  It's my life.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
He's got a houseboat.
It sounds nice.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Does it have wheat in it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
What was what?
Actually, he sounded nice.
Not.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
So I mailed your letter.
M.F.E.O.?
Okay.
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Howard.
Yes, I did.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
Mom, we already...
It's a sign.
It's me?
Grace heard it.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
It's not that late in Seattle.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Seventy... eight.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
I don't know.  Do I?
It's a spice rack.
It's never happening again. Right?
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
I know.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
No.
I just called for a second.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
Okay.
Sure.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
You look good yourself.
You could have called me --
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
I don't make policy.
It never ends.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
No.
Can be what?
I'm going back tomorrow.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Sun up.
Like what?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
I thought maybe you forgot...
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
You should have helped her without being asked.
Shhh.
Yeah.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Now that's down-right insulting.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I understand. Thanks anyway.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Then leave.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
What happened to your eye?
And you admire that?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
Please open the door, Danny.
Why?
Danny, it's not what you think.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Twelve
You on a roll?
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Not tonight.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
No. I'm good.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
When? When did you ever see me use?
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Hey, okay.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
This chink have a name?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Yeah.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
And you've got wiener breath.
There's no motels around here.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't worry about it.
...alright, let me know when.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Of course, sir.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Say what, Cap'n?
You know classical music?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I don't expect to live that long.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
You don't count.
Sure, you got one?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
I've got a line on one.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
That's not what we're here for.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Vecchio.
Yeah.
Bits and pieces.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
Just what I want to do.
I'll do my best.
You're welcome, John.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
But, sir...
Sure, Reiben.
Ours is not to reason why.
But we accomplish the mission.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
We know.
What about you, Captain?
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Who knows?  It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
And your former wife.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
C'mon Lloyd.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
I like him a lot.
You're right.
Alright.
Yeah?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Hmmm....
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Pardon me?
Goodbye.
Would you hold this for me?
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
That's cool then.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Today is tomorrow.
You think so?
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Be friends?
Yeah?
Oh.  I was putting the...
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
What's wrong?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Just my dad.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
Man, you're bringing me down!
No.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Fine Lloyd.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Alright!
I love you too.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
War.
You're kidding.
They're not gone, they're here.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
It's good business.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Look it up.
There's nothing in the stores.
Nice things cost money.
Yeah.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I need a drink.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
So I'll talk to him about it.
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Yes.
Yes.
And killing.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Why would you wanna do that?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Let us decide that.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
You’re not going to get away with this.
I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I know that.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good.
Meaning?
Can we turn the light on?
And Joel's pre-med.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Yeah, right.
Just in case...
I'll give you one guess.
That's not the way we play the game.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
My morn was a Delta.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Is Sid in therapy?
Hello?  Hello?
Yeah, right.
I'd really just like to be alone.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
You're not allowed to ask that.
Gale?
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Shush.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
I don't know.
Thanks.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
What did you know about your mother?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
What does this have to do with Sid?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
And who is that?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Do you want us to come with you?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
But you know who she was.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Sure.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Need to get in that building?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Who's this.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Huh, fine.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
W-what do you want?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Are you sure?
I'm sorry, your voice.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
You know it.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's okay. We need to talk.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
You don't still think it was me?
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Fuck you.
What number is this?
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
You're making popcorn?
Really? What?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Don't...
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
More of a game, really.
Or else what?
I believe you...
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
That all depends on you.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on, yes you do.
I can't think.
NOOOO....
Please go away! Leave us alone!
No it's not. It was Jason.
No, not yet.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
What kind of lead?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I don't think you're so bad.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
...yeah...
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
Afraid not.
Not yet.
How is everything?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Not my daughter... not my...
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Yes, that's right.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Ricki Lake.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Hello Sidney.
Can you knock?
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
The why'd the police let him go?
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
How do you gut someone?
I'm not worried.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
And you believe it?
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Deal.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
What are you talking about?
It would be too hard.
It's not too far away now.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers?
Sit back.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
No one yet.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
What about sports?
I read.  Remember reading?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Okay.  But, what?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
Yes we do.  Here...
Let's go.
Him?
You got to be kidding.
We're focusing.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
I'm fine.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
I... I don't understand.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
How should I know?
Why don't you finish the job?
Huh...? No...no water.
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
I ain't wearing no gun.
No sir...pleasure.
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
By what you preach...none!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Now mount up, son...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Good night...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
But I just bought a good blanket.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Never heard of him...
Not likely.
Not far from it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
From the beginning...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Finish your breakfast...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Come on, say it.  You know...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Do you have a better idea?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
I just had a really strange experience.
We just have to make a new beginning.
What?
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village.  Look what I found.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Tenth floor.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
And the title of this piece?
The title won't do.
Right you are, governor!
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo
Ten pounds.
Ned is wrong for it.
Done.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Cut his nose off.
And his ears.
Partners!
A share of the profits.
Very well.
Yes, but very well.
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
I don't know, it's a mystery.
How will it?
Good title.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
A different one you haven't written?
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
And I love poetry above all.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I like her.
You have opened the playhouses?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
I have to get back.
Oh
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh--no, no!
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I was the more deceived.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
My lord.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
My hat?
Do you understand me?
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
It is only ours you can know.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
You are on my ground.
Serve.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Come on, David.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
He couldn't get his car started.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
Now.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
I beg your pardon?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah?
This is just an informal discussion.
What does it look like?
What?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Yes.
I see.
What?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Really?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
So I gathered.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Open it.
Did what?
What? What's wrong?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
No, I don't.
Are you all right?
No, no, it's different.
What are you doing here?
Your painful groin?
Oh, good.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I'll wait there.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
No.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
What?
Yeah.
What about?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
What?
No one.
You and me?
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Eh --
Yes, sir.
I'm boring?
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
Would you like to see the rest?
A priest who dies.
It's an improvement.
I'm a doctor.
And that's not the same thing?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Maybe... why do you ask?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
That's okay too.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Gee, that's very serious...
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Calm down, baby.
What about?
Yes.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
No.
I guess so.
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
... yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Why?
Then what do you think?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Great.
Right.
I guess not...
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
Buffums?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great.
Did I what?
Yeah?
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
No you didn't.
You were great.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
We're friends.
-- yes, you --
-- we are?
It's too late...
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- why did you come in today?
Okay... thanks...
That's too bad.
Who?
You said somebody... who?
Keep moving --
How?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
What about me?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Great.
How did it go at the bank?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
Where's your car?
Look at the way I live.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Jesus.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
What did you say?
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
What about, tonight?
Isn't that bad for it?
Oh Jesus Christ.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
What, do you think I planned it?
Didn't they tell you?
Who?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Wasn't sure it was you.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
No.
I'll call you back.
And?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Aren't you going to have one?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
You know what's wrong.
Who is that?
George is great but I know what you mean.
-- No. No really.
But you have problems?
I'm exaggerating.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
Well, there was this one time --
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
Of course not.
You're going.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- just wonderful.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Do you like this hotel?
I guess so.
What do you mean?
French Fries and Ketchup.
I'm not supposed to.
Do they know he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Try to think what it was.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Danny, come on over here.
All right.
Okay...oh!
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Oh!
No.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Why not?
Do I have to?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Well how can I repay you?
Fine.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Good.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Thank you for saying so.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Good.
Yes.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Give me the bat.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
They'll love it.
Well, it's very... homely.
Royalty?
How do you do?
Eight thirty.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
What's that?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Yeah.
What if it's some kind of monster?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Yeah! What is it?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I told you!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
We won't!
You know what we're saying!
Were you tempted?
SING!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What did who say?
Good evening, Vincent.
What is it, Betty?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Am I?
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
What a shame!
Were you wicked?
You know that song?
Um, I don't really know this one...
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Again!
Five a.m.?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
What?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Keep moving!
Experience!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
We're nuns!
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
It's true!
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
What's a concubine?
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Useless distractions.
And whom would you call?
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
No.  No.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
But...
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Don't push it.
Then-you run.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Maybe Hawaii.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
How?
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Even nuns have to pee.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hail, Mary.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
It didn't happen.
It didn't work, Vince.
Maybe pants.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Yes?
It's better than ice cream.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Many have.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I hit him square.
Excuse me?
A diseased monster.
... Brom Bones...
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
I shall, gladly.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
Believe?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
I'm sure I don't know.
Up.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
Should we go back?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
In test... what?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
And, what did he say?
What would you have me believe?
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Yes, actually.
You are from the Hollow?
No one will believe your lies, whore.
May I see my mother?
She did not do it... please listen...
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
It went real good.
I hate you!
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
I thought I told you to keep out!
Why? Hi, Karl.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Why did he do that, reckon.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A little ol' boy.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Is that right?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm glad of it, honey.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I ain't got no boy.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon.
Yes sir.
My history.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
I'll be dog.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Ma'am?
What's that you say?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
No, we have to get this story.
Yes sir.
No thank you.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Signs?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Better make it charge. 
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Fuck you, kid.
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
You're looking good, Auggie.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Bully for you.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
Sure thing. See you later.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
The refrigerator?
How the hell did you get into the building?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
What's your offer?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I owe you something.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
In Manhattan?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
He's dead?
How long have you been here?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
You don't really want to know.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
I just did.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
His only copy?
Here, catch.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Yes, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And the next one...?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection!
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Won't take two.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
I should show them an American?
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
I can't speak for him.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Such as?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bull fiddle.
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
I'll say.
Hey, Joe!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Watch it, Daphne!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Fight it.
I got pinched in the elevator.
You - you -
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm engaged.
Security.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Get me Room 414.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
If there's anything I can do for you -
That's ridiculous.
You got some?
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
What's that?
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Well, I'll come back later.
Yes.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Yes.  For a whole year.
- you got to be blonde -
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
You invest in shows?
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Sorry.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
And I can never have children.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Yes, Joe.
William Morris!
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Who are you?
Up, up, up.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
Tonight?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
They repealed Prohibition?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's the crews' night off.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Oh, no!
How can you think about food at a time like this?
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
All right - if you insist.
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
Good morning.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Booze.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Big joke!
You and who else?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Except it’s Scotch.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Still--
Jeffrey told her last night.
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Oh, don’t be that way.
Yeah, kind of.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Kat.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
A weekend?
Okay.
Show me.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Just drunk enough.
“...but it’s getting there. “
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Will do.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Yes, mam...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
NO! N-O, NO!
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
He'll show up one day.
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Mornin', Daddy...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
My father taught me...
Yes, David...
I don't look like no possum!
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
You sure can, son...
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
They probly thought you was crazy.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
I wanta see Nathan.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
My head hurts.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Okay.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Yes, hon?
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Hey, Chef.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Uhh...
Mph rm.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Aw, ma!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Yeah...
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
What's the difference?
Totally!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Me?!
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Yes?
Oh God... What have I done...
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey, come here, guy.
I am.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You don't care.
Don't call me dumb!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
They're not going to make it!
Magnificent, magnificent.
Of course, of course...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well shut it off at once!
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
You better start making sense!
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
That's clear.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Will you shut up already?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Just considering our options... sir.
You're right.
Close every door behind you!
Wait.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Why?  Where are you going?
Barnes?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Over and out.
We have room!  Let's go!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
It would matter to us.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Mac.  What's shaking?
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
One moment please...  one moment please...
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Find your bowler?
Nope.
What do you want with old man Faz?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
I got a right. You're my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
What's it look like to you?
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
You got a better offer?
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I couldn't care less.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
You shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
No!
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What ever happened to just bowling?
I like the sport the way it is.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Where can I find him?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
What do you want with my dad?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
Not while I'm in training.
No. Do You?
No, I'm fascinated.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
So why do you stay?
More than you could afford.
Why not?
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
Tell me what happened Theo.
What about plan C?
I'm looking for somebody.
Your time is up, busyboy.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Open it, Captain!
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Back away then.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What was that?
What if it attacks?
Do you see it?
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Nothing else.
Storm?  What storm?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Hold on --
It's impossible.
What team?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
I don't know.  That's the point.
What do you mean, he's missing?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Pull it.
Well, where the fuck is he?
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Ted seems to have some ideas.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
He understands me fine.
She's not gonna know, sir.
Radiation shield, you think?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
It never occurred to me.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
So what?
What?
You did, didn't you?
You bastard.
I have to reset the sub.
How do you spell it?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What do you mean, different?
How's Harry?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
You think I manifested the snakes?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
It's not safe for you to be either.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Hear what?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Who says it's a he?
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Just in time for what?
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Look, would you --
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Am I?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What are they?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
I thought she was with you.
Wisconsin?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Shut up and open the door.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Shut up and catch.
Wait!
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Meaning?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Arrived?  From where?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
"We are friends".
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You mean a picture?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Unless it's an act.
Not that I know of.  Why?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
What?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
I'm beginning not to like you.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
He can't find Organa Major.
You mean we should go after her!...
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
You don't believe in the Force?
Not if this tunnel deadends.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
It's what I deserve.
What do I want with a scar ?
YAAAAAAAA !
I didn't see him !
What about it, Diz ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Funny...
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Who ?
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Excuse me...!
Carl can wait.
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I can't help it.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Alright, I love you.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
See you on the bounce !
We've gotta go get her !
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Hut... hut !
You got it.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
Keep trying, Sergeant.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Uh, no.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Been better, buddy.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Good for you. Go find out.
Yes, sir !
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Give'em hell, sir !
To join with him.
You may proceede.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Mr Decker....
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
This served the purpose.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
A tractor beam...
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
I need a typewritter.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
No, no, I see...
I live there.
Mmm.
You're still here.
You'd know better'n me.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
<u>Yes</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Never saw the point of 'em.
"Room Service!"
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Oh yeah.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What is it, a surprise?
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
That's so beautiful...
Where have you been...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Courthouse back in town.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
She's a...
You mind...?
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Yes, yes, but...
I can't do it, Walt.
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I'm only trying to...
The minute I read that script I said...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I'll put the, in your r...
I can't tell.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Well.
What is the...?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
Later for you, pal.
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
How about that.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
I can't find the writer.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
I can only write on a manual.
I grew up on your mov...
Where have you been...?
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
The girl was in the car.
I don't...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
He's got a gift for fiction.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
...not the Lazyboy...
Sherry, this...
And we're glad to have you here...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
...the city council...
George, that is so kind of you.
So we just got lucky.
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Bet you did.
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I don't care.
Excellent point.
That will never happen.
What are you gonna talk about?
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Great.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
MOMMY!
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Annabelle put down that camera.
Cos she loves you.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Pray.  We never find out.
No!  I have to get there.
Oh.
I helped.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Every day.  More and more.
Let's take our best shot.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
We're not discussing your age.
Easy enough.
You're WHERE?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
A lot smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You're not dying.
See, I know that.
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
You're a cross-dresser.
You mean, after I'm dead?
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Don't be too sure.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Worked.  Like a charm.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
You'll learn.
I have their past.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, it may take time.
It's no biggie.
I know that.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Great to be here.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God's will.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I'm always working.
My Jesus…
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Yes, I do. I love them!
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
Nothing, I guess…
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
What?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
How was the class?
Fine.
You know he hated my story also.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Thanks.
OK!
What are you doing here?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Eight, six, and four.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Yeah. I know.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
He did?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Well get someone down there!
What happened!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Used to Filmore, used to.
Because I'll be firing at them.
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Well Cooper...
Even better.
Where does it lead?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Like where--in your dreams?
I don't want any...
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
She's as good as gone...
I'll let the senator tell you.
What do you mean?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Moffo!
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
General Schmuck?
What did you say, sir?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Yes?
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
This is General Ripper speaking.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
No, sir.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
No, sir.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Yes, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
To peace on earth.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
What?
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Call them every five miles.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Yeah?
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Very interesting.
Forget it.
Seond safety.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Quentin, how's your gear?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Knock yourself out.
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
What?
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Sorry.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Okay.
So you can do an album cover?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
What, they're looking for her?
No. It didn't, Buff.
Look.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Buff is funny. God.
I can come visit?
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Glad it's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
What'd he get you?
Oh, yeah?
It's a mistake to think that.
Yeah?
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Pony and I are friends.
He's drunk.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Ask your girlfriend.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Wow. You did that for me?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Look, your trespassing.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
So you can give me more shit?
What? What do you stand for?
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Yeah.
Sooze.
And?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Yes, you do.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Shit, Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Oh, fuck it, man!
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Like songs?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
What?
Camel jockey.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Hey!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's stupid.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh, yeah?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Mine too.
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
If you hit me...
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Don't swear it's impolite.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Sorry, Kansas...
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Yeah.
Trix...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
He Ikea'd us.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Hold on...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Definitely old.
Uh...maybe?
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Now how the hell can I help you?
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Hi, Artie.
Close, but no cigar.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Phillip, you're mad!
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Who's who?
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
What were you -- a child actress?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
Whose house is it?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
It is not.  Get out.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I don't know.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
I've lost my car.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Who?
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Where are your...?
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Good.
Yes, I am, Norma.
Madame is waiting.
I'm not here.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
You know better than to interrupt me.
But where?
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Sorry, mistress.
No, a super girl.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
You love me?
Tell me where I can find her.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
What?
She has hostages.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I'll drink to that.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I could force you.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You vicious--
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Supergirl?
Why George, are you proposing?
Nice to meet you.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Oh, no thanks.
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
She's a beast.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
It doesn't seem right.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I'd love to.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Then come with me.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
Too much mayonnaise?
Who?
You thought that?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, thanks.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Thirty-five.
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
I know, I'm the fault.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Who gets it, the company?
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Or socks.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
You designed it?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Sister! I'm his sister!
I didn't have my camera with me.
You just did, with that great dinner.
But the bridge...
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Don't cry, Bubba.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Be my guest.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
Lois, you're amazing.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Let's go to my place.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
What else is ballast for?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
I'll be alright.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
No possibility for parole?
To ski?
What do you want?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Cuba.
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
We must combine our strength.
I really don't think . . .
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
What about here?
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Don't worry, I've got you.
If you say so. Here goes.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Who?
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Destiny.
I am master now.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
It was hot, yes.
But otherwise it's swell.
What the  --  !
Oh.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
You?! How about me?
Of course I can. I love you.
What's your name, boy?
Folks'll ask question.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
195 pounds.
Sure.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Maybe I should get help.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Was it good?
Why?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Billy, that's too early.
A while.
When the game's over, I guess.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
From what?
Did they give him special care?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
I did.
Yes.
I'll...take it straight.
Yes.  It's a present.
Okay.
Oh.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
And what was the weather like at this time?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
What do they do?
No.
Thanks.
I need money.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Who did they get for that?
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
In what way?
Yes.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
No.
You don't know that.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Hitler!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Thanks, I see him...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Hurry back.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
No, I wouldn't...
No.  I'm going home.
Now don't kid a kidder.
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You print them, don't you?
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
When?
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
You're incapable of the truth...
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
What about?
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
At the bar - Sidney...
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
What kind of an act is this?
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
The renting agent and the tailor.
I know you do, Sidney.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
What ship?
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Those lying motherfuckers!
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
Now listen to me very carefully.
Let me try mine.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Liquid metal.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
She intends to change the future somehow.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Go!  I'll finish here.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
And what it that?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
No.  There is another chip.
On all what?
Respect your elders and your betters!
I don't know.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Yeah.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
What is this, Emmi?
What's not right?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
That is correct.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
I wish to say something.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
What?
Me? Never.  Never.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Right. Claims assessor.
Like this bandleader.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Freezing.
Kyle.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
That's not my mission.
You must have had a fun child-
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
No.  I'm not.
Someone?
Kyle...
You're not supposed to.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Okay.
I know.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Shut up.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
The stock will turn.
Did you?  Kudos.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I said I was sorry...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's turning blue!
What... is... happening... ?
You should be.
You pull me up.
What's C.R.S.?
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
You?
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
Nicholas...
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
I'm back from the dead.
Where'd you get that gun?
Fuck you.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I saw them kill him!
Shut up!
That's not true...
I have to show you...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
I said I would...
I'm going to call.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Robbed?
Have you gone to the police?
There's nothing to forgive.
Yes.
No, thank you.
A game?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Like, this way... sort of...
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Is there a room key?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Ilsa... you're alright?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
No.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Why are you following me?
Attempted murder.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Greetings.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Why?
There's a carriage house around back.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Just stay there, Nell!
Luke.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
You want company?
-- how much is this car worth?
Where in the hell can she be.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
It was.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
That?  That's Hill House.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
No, it's getting worse.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
It's not a knock.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
What kind of food?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
We all did.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Why not?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Round about, yeah.
Huh?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Y'what?
This ain't your lot?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Not me, man.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
That would be too easy.
Probably.
Really.
No, but I know what he means.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Why not.
Just now?  Overnight?
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
How do you know?
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
He had urgent business in the north.
Ian?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Five thousand.
I got half.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Something's on.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
I doubt it.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Who's looking for you?
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Yes. Thank you.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
We've certainly missed you.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Boy.
Geez, Mr Crane.
He didn't say that.
Birdy--
Well? How'd she do?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
No. I--tell me--
Way out of line.
Cash.
Uh-huh.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Come on in.
Just coffee.
Told what?
So?
Mm.
Honey...
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
I took Doris's keys.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Sure you don't need one?
He a good man?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Yeah.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Yeah.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
No thanks, I--
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
We're just closing, friend.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
I appreciate that.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
Where's the walk-in safe?
Calm down.  I found it!
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
You said the system couldn't fail!
Where the hell are you?
Whose footprints?
Call me Vince.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
The sub-basement?
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Look who's here, Margo.
I don't believe it.
He's right.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
He's right.  Follow me.
Frock's been fired.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Okay.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't know.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
The planetarium!
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
What?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
He gave it back to his father.
Thank you.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
It has to be the reality.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
Yeah?  Outta what?
Yeah, what happened?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Who?
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
I won't be late.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I made macaroni.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Oh, my God!
There's been an accident, Truman.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Do something...
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Sorry. Don't have one.
Me?
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Nothing completely conclusive --
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
How?
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
What did it look like?
You're looking for a bomb.
What happened to playing a hunch?
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
It's locked?
No you didn't.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Something sweet.
Nice try, Mulder.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
No.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I don't know.
Mulder --
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
I don't know, Mulder.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
I don't have his number.
About what?
She was with me.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
What alien environment?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
No.
Okay.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
I realize that...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Peter, okay?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
You're sure of that?
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He's beautiful...
Delano?
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I think that's the whole point.
Absolutely.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
What else do we do?!
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Next time, tell me, okay?
They think you did it.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Dr. Winkel.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell you what?
Where is she?
Anna.
It's just what he used to say.
I thought you wanted...
I don't know.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
How did you know I would be here?
Oh, the usual things...
His.
And my passport?
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I don't want it.
Yes, of course.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Fellow called Lime.
No.
Holly Martins.
No.
It wasn't petrol.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
You're not locking her up?
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Bring him in.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Well, there's not much time.
This way, miss.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
No, I don't know...
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
No, a major, were you really?
Goodness, that's awkward.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I told the police.
And - Anna...
You wouldn't do anything.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Coffee.
What did he say?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Yes.
Coming to the point, please.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Here.
Thanks.
We moved rooms because of him.
Why?
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
What!
Yes.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
You can swim?
Two.
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
We swim.
No.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
Incredible.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Where did you lose it?
Uh-huh.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They don't have extermination camps.
What??
That's a movie, you moron.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Why the fuck not?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Disease? What disease?
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Oh, really?
He's at a home out here.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
What do you care?
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
Obviously.
What about Curtis Zampf?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
What??!?
Notice? Like what...?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Of course they're Jews.
Are all Jews the same?
No.
Get the fuck away from me.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
A forty-five.
I can't say that.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
From the Rhineland originally.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Who told you that?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You could do it.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Who even knew?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
JTS...?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Get out of my way.
Why me?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Valentine...
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
In a lake.
Have you known him long?
No.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Enzo!
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Lira?
What does that mean?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Enzo...
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Not at all!
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
It's too loud for me.
Lucky I was there to save you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Uh... Yes, of course!
It's me... Johana.
I'm still here.
No... tell me.
... Not at all.
Absolutely positive.
You go back, I'll walk.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Again?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Why is he doing this?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
What's your first move?
What's up?
What do you want me to do?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
C'mon follow me.
Sure. Why not.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Worse.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Why not?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
No. I'm serious about this.
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Hey —— I'm over here.
No. I'm quite sure.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
We're old friends.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
Just barely possible - - yes.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
It's better you don't know.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
That was a calamity!
Go on foot.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Don't be soft.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
And not a sign of the leopard?
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
I know. Funerals.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
We will ——
Must it?
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Aren’t you curious to know about Friedman?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
No!
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
You splendid bastard...
...We’re turning in circles.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
You wouldn’t understand.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Yeah.
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Emily...
This is a bad line.
Yes... Good, good...
What?
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
What kids?
I’ll call again.
Should I?
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
Yes. How did...
I hope it’s not too significant.
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
When... I’m told he came here...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Three o’clock.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
I’ll be alone.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Can I get up now?
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
I... How long have I been here?
Los Angeles?
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
Alors quoi?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
The acid bath?
That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
If he had, you’d be dead.
What do you think, huh?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Of course I am, it's just that...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
Jeanne, no...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I don't know...
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Performing a miracle.
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Scared of a girl?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
I'm... I'm not the king...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Go on to the next question.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Yes, but...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Yes!
Yes... lots of things!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Who wants me to stop?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Wladek, please.
He'll be back before curfew.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
I'll be fine.
It costs.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who's recruiting?
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
That makes a change.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Just shut up.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Cow!
You're a dirty pig!
You made contact?
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Yes, like a cave.
... without a shred of manners.
Like it were a piano?
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Nothing just yet
No.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
It's my mother's piano.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
No.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Don't worry about it, pal.
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
You think my play is bad?
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
What about the other one?
Who's got the contract?
What do ya want the others to get?
You sober?
I picked something up on the way.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
We'll get by without 'em.
What do ya mean?
He threatened to kill me.
It was too noisy.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Think nothin' of it.
What the hell for?
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
All right, when?
I feel lucky tonight.
Yeh, he knows that.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Then why the rat?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You got a system, Carver?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
No.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
We missed him.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Is that what it means?
I'm sorry.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
He's just around the corner.
Nothing.
Don't cry.
You've got to get your mind off this.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
There!
Hello, there!
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
She could tell you where father is.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
What's he want of you?
Man to man, I'm not.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
No.
Nunheim!
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Rosebreen.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Did you go?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
What bonds?
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
Slim.
What do you think?
Well, don't you?
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Hello, baby.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
They were kidding you.
Breakfast.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
You did.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
That's a fact.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Huh?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
No... no.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Maybe I do.
Then get up and do something about it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Why'd he come in our camp.
We're at war.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I've got no stomach for murder.
What if I do?
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
What about Jaeger?
We thought--
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Blow me.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
...I know.
We leave it.
I got that...sir.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Just be cool.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Stay low.
So where do we start?
What?
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
We'll lie.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.  Well, me too.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Don't you touch it.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Then I'm a rich man.
Thanks.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I don't know.
What?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Like I said; so?
What!?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Yes!
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Correct.  Origin?
Permant cortex bond.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Don't be so sure.
It's 3+27 hundred
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
No one can see us now we're alone.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
I don't feel well.
Too late....stay close.
What kind of answer is that?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
All right...
Yes...
You should know better than that!
Where are they?
Officer Reilly, vice.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
What do you mean?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Then let's go see what they missed.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Be right back.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Would you?
Off the scale.
Nothing.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
Helluva fuck factor.
Alex-
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuck factor ten.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Quiet!
I promised her she'd be safe.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Amsterdam?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Nice suit.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Just a second.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
What is it?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--no.
I would like to.
Why should you?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Darling!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Ah!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Spanish passports?
Lily-- 
Yes.
I remember.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh!
What's wrong now?
As you like. 
Right!
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
You're hired!
Good night.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
I know all your tricks.
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>must</u> go.
No--thirty-five! 
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Call the police?
I don't believe it!
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
I know!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I don't want your money!
That's true.
But you saw it here.
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
Don't drop it Rose.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
She knows.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Not the better half.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Almost as good as you.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Bollocks.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
You're crazy.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Well, here you are.
Just some sketches.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Could it have damaged the ship?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
I know, I know.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Excuse me.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Sure!
I can explain--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
That's a date. 
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Where's Lother?
I could stand some more--
So you washed it off!
Never eat before the show.
Brett is the name.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
But--
Sally--!
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
What do you know about them?
I'll be waiting on deck.
What's the matter?
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
--there's thousands of 'em!
Change?
Are you screwy?
What is it?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Sure, I'll go.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Why, I--
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
Send that.
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Miss Marsh.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Are you happy?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Like it?
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Very serious?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Thank you.
"Smooth's" the word.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Telegrams.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Maybe even my destiny.
Well I'm not so go home.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
Excuse me?
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Yeah, you look it.
In pace requiescat.
Here it come: one-two-
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
How you feelin', Doc?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right.  Then what?
I don't.
What?  But I saw 'em-
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
I know.  Me neither.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
You'd die for fun?
I laugh sometimes
What about her?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Getting late.  We better get back.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No really, I can stay a while.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
That what you got me up here for?
Forget it, Ringo.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
What're you talkin' about?
Fine.  Better.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Jack...
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Sir Elliot.
I see.
I can feel your pain.
Sightseeing.
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your time -
Where can I find him?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
That's reassuring.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Three. You? Married?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Think about mom.
He was my father's best friend!
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Don't say it.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Next time, I do the driving.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Now.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
No -
I see you two have met.
Get more men up there!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Will the cruise set it off?
We got the same thing.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
They're too big.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Why in the h...
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Hush.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
That's nice.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I was just trying to make conversation.
You know the man next door is near death.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Where was the last place you left him?
But what if we leave them behind?
What?  What is it?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sorry.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
I can't see a thing!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Last present!
I can't quite make out -- 
No, Slink --
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
But you're Irish!
There's no mirror.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Finn -
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
H'm?
All the time.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I can't find Manolo.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Why?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
So's the video camera.
I don't know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
How long's the job?
You can't make me.
Sixteen
Then here's a little bump.
So does half of San Diego.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Yeah.
Who?
Your new friends.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Where?
Javier Rodriguez.
If I can.
Everybody has a weakness.
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Bit fucking late, like.
Jesus.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
I'd fucking kill you.
What?
Ssshh!
Shut up.
Right. You can't sleep here.
It's Iggy Pop.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
Aye.
No, I'm clean.
Yeah.
Nightmare.
Another dab?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
you'll need one more hit.
As you wish.
Yeah.
Such as?
Are you serious?
Six weeks.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
He doubts me.
Rescued at last.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
I don't have a clue.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
What do you know of my pain?
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
If we could send a distress signal...
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Because it's there.
MM.?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Goodnight, Bones.
Fascinating.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
A "t."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
The emergency channel, open.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.

"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Do you?
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Hello, Alan.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Not a chance.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
Greetings, program...
How about you?
How 'bout yourself?
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
You're getting out of the business?
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
I had to...in the games...
As long as it gets us out of here
It's something Users do.
Where are you going?
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
You're kidding.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
Yes.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
I thought you moved out.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Okay.  Here she comes.
Son of a bitch!
You want me to just hang-- ?
It can't be.  Not Helen.
I still don't believe it.
Put a tap on her phone.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
What are you talking about?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Yes what?
Me too.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Do you still love your husband?
Louder please.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Did you pork her Harry?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Go ahead.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
What is it you need me to do?
Helen.
I just glances inside.
His wife.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The oriental.
Want some Goobers?
I took a cab.
Sure. Why not?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
Uh-huh.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Thank you.
I just gotta get somethin'.
What?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Really?
What?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
I heard that.
Heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
So you do eat pussy!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Get the fuck outta here!
I know.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
He trusts you?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
I bullshitted him.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Do you still have friends on the force?
No shit?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Or a supporting actor -
This guy's gonna kill him.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
Pussy love pink rocks.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
No way, JosÈ.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Read my lips.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Donowitz, he said.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
What are you going to do with us?
What's she doing?
No.
It's so clean.  No germs.
What year is it?
What?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
I thought I was in...prison again.
It was?  I didn't...know.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
Hey, man...
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Might be tight.
You can't do that yourself?
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Yeah, yeah.
Christ!
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
It is not.
Time.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just a car.
Don't look like nothing.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
You son of a bitch!
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Yes.  Yes it is.
John . . .
What do you want?
John--
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
They look nice.
You didn't hear something?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I don't know your real name.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
No.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
You live pretty good.
What about us?
Because I know you're full of shit.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Don't yell at me!
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
What about him?
Give him the money.
You killed him!
But I want to say with you,
I'll get it.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
A lot that means.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
I had a problem getting my car back.
I did?
You're talking like a mad man.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
What makes you say that?
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Make it twenty.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
No.
Darrell giving you problems?
Liar.
Christ, Jake, please--
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
How old are you?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
Get away from me!
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Oh, shit!
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
What happened?
I guess.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
What for?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Eh?
You want something?
I said I was sorry.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Oh, shit!
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Like you don't know.
How do you know if you've never tried?
About what you said this morning.
What makes you say that?
You love her, but you hate her?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
No!
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
What are you talking about!
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
You're too quick for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
What the hell are you talking about?
Will you shut up!
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
So?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
How much!?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
I'm just going to my car?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You're welcome, Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Those are white words, not ours.
I have an idea.
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Is it pretty?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
No! You get it!
Good thinking.  What's all this?
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
What are you talking about?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Can you make it back up?
Harlin's.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
Which you don't have.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
But, in particular?
How much?
One way.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Oh?
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Wrong number.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
You've made a considerably wise decision.
Four.
What did I say?
Do you remember me getting sick?
Yes.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Oh.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Think carefully?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
We are.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I'll help you.
No.
That's great.
Know what?
You're lying.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Okay.
Fine.
No.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Where is it?
Innocent of what?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Advances?
She back in Kansas?
Oh.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
He admit it?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Give it to him.
Did you... kill him?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
I could of... easy.
Huh?
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Lookin' at?
Well... I don't recollect.
What happened, did you hit him?
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
Shut up, Kid.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
You better get on back, Miss.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
Beats the hell out of me.
You're marking us, Bill.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Two.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Tom?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Did I what?
Nothin's bent.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
Just forget about it.
Goddamnit.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
They fucking know everything.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
County. I was in for fraud.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
If you'll just let me -
Tough break.
Not if we do it my way.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
You're lying.
Business or personal?
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I just want to hear your story.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
No.
I'm not a rat.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Kobayashi.
Give a guy a break, huh?
I never heard of him.
Because he was my friend.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
I'm fine.
Yes.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
You thought it was just.
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Well, we...
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I'm on the staff of...
Huh!
It's a crime.
No.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I've got nothing to say to you.
And ask me what?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm sure you would.
What?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Overruled...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
Kathy Price.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
I think I will.
Maybe what?
It's over!
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
Don't touch anything.
What?
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I can't talk now.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
That's Carlotta Valdes.
I -- I --
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Let me come in.
You won't have to.
No, you don't owe me anything.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
I'll take care of you.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
Wherever you'd like...
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
No!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Your accident...
Some money.
I loved you, Madeleine.
No...
Where had you been before?
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
I... didn't know where you lived.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
No, thank you.
Yes...
What?!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
And it's a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Please let me go.
Yes... you run this hotel.
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
What's tomorrow?
Why?
It's where you belong.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
That's following a train of thought.
Three whole weeks.
What.
Okay.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Do you know him well?
Nothing to tell.
Did you need it?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What?
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Playing?
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not getting a ticket.
You want to hear me out?
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just giving the facts.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
I don't give a damn.
They won't figure it out.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No. I think it's fucked.
I know...
It has to be done.
What.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
There's more.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
The groom?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Not tonight.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I'm talking about prayer.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
He's having a problem here.
What did you ask me?
Say it again.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What does that mean?
I don't know...
What does that mean?
Hear what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
I do.
We missed the deadline.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Yes.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
What?
Well it's bad timing.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
What kind of seats can we have?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
What are you doing?
I'm working on it.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Can we just talk this out?
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
But...
What does that mean?
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
About what?
I don't hear it.
Have another drink.
The wahoo?
Yup.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Did he try to kiss you?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
Take your time. I wish I had.
Drum banging real times.
That's right.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
What's that?
What about them?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Who is she?
Come down.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Thank you, Uncle.
Whatever you like.
She won't even know.
Yes.
That's it.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
You're happy, aren't you!
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
What's he called?
Stop this!
A black bull came.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Me? What did I do?
Why wasn't I told?
Catch him and your record's clean.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
I'm getting by.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Where's my gun?
Then I guess we're even.
On my life, I promise you I will.
You think he's smart?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Not from in here.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
This is supposed to be years away.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
All my work is my finest.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Stop me.
Enjoying yourself?
You like baseball?
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
Lindenmeyer?
Sid?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
I don't think you're gonna need it.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
He's not fine.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What rig?
What are you talking about?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
Who would find out?
...that's the general idea.
In the yellow ribbon.
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
Get on this, right now...
...this's <u>good</u>...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
...what are we going to do...?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Where's my pill...?
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
I'll play your silly game.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Why Albania?
The... 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
"Freedom."
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
President's speech.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Of what?
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
...givem what they want...But...
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It's too clean.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
See y'at the Finish Line.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
Leopard Skin...
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
Yes.
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
A beret.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
They don't know what's going on!
Oh really.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
I don't understand.
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
...Gordon.
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
What does that mean?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Obviously...
Gordon.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
And what do you want?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Oh Christ!
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
With Mark?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Businessman!
Hmm.
Thank you
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Who's is all this?
Right behind you.
They're all human beings
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Hey.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Do you really think so?
You're joking.
How do you know it's a she?
Nope.
You were in an accident?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
She isn't here.
I don't know.
Is everything alright?
You do?
Please leave me alone.
I don't know.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
...no...no...no...
What?
I don't...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
The planchette?
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Relieved?
I know.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Did he say that?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I don't know...
Don't.
Not the focus.
Tomorrow.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Unless you need me to come home...
Oh, no...
That's...
What?  No.  No.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What?
A flare?
What am I looking at?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
I will NOT.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
...Please stop...
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
How did she know where it was?
We don't know that for sure.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
What?
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Then what is he...?
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Michael, Rowan should -
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
When did she die...?
I under5tand.  All the same
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
She didn't feel them
'He'...?
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
He just went out like & light-
Lie...?
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
It's too soon to know.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I know.    you are my son -
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Rowan...
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
And whose houses do you design...?
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Captain's orders.
All I meant was -
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
God knows, I'm intriguing.

Hello..
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
That's cause we're below sea level.
Talking to me dear...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Gotcha.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
No - not all the time - I mean
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I really don't know what to say
I'm a dentist
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Open it...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
It's what you would do to me
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You heard me - keep away from him
Yes...?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
That's crazy talk.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Astronomical.
Cut it out, before you break something!
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Yeah, whatever.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Let me get this straight...
Ladies first.  I insist.
Yeah?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
But that smile.
Yeah? You like?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Which you pulled, hard!
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We miss you. We miss our son.
Dad, please.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
What do you want me to do?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
You want it in writing?
I didn't forget.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Then I'll write about YOU.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
I doubt it.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
That's hard to believe.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Rules are rules.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Seldom? No kidding?
Tipping?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
My job. Back off, Benedict.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Eat a power bar.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He was large?
No.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Suzie?
Back to the land of grownups.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
You have someplace to be?
Just check out the car.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
Your Honor... Please...
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Do it to ourselves?
Yes.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You think that's wise?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Just like that?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You got something against cigarettes?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Funny.  So am I.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Aha?
Starting with a screw?
Prepare what?
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Almost?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
It's better than nothing.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
I'm sure we will.
Yes, me!
My friend?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
This is Colonel Richards.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
Nicely said, sir.
On my way to Denver...
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Who was this partner of his?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
It is?
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Say what?
Madmartigan.
Good.  How long will it take?
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
I hate this.
Of course!  I promise!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
That's all I ever wanted!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
More!  More!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Me neither!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
I changed her already!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Cows. You know, cows?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
John, I don't understand any of this.
Try the house.
Pretty much.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
You don't say.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Sure have, Sam.
Oh, he's good.
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Who else knows?
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
Move! Or you die right here!
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
I can't.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Not long... A few days.
Aren't you? After today?
Johnny, what the fuck?
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
Yes, thank you very much.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
They are English. They don't understand.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Do you presume to criticize the....
You are?
I don't believe you!
Oh!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Whenever you wish.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, you....
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Stop her!
Well, you're perfect now.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
No, but you tried to.
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Where's Kansas?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes -- that's true.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
To Oz?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
It did?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
What was that?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Not nohow!
You mean she bit you?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Ho -- ho --ho
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
We'll get you together!
Oh --
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
Elektra King.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
But what if...
We can’t.
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
Quite the opposite, in fact.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Indeed.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
Yes.
Yes.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Really?
He used your exact words.
You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
Where did you get this?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
How appropriate.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Someone will come.
Is it?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
And what if you¹re wrong?
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Isn't it true that you --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Ever see one of these before?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
That's exactly why we need them.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
"Anarchy" 99"?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
I'm from L.A.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
That one I'm real familiar with.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Is this what you're looking for?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
This is a gift. From me to you.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
We all do.
Beast.
Its core?
For what purpose?
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
What's that?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
You know, you --
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
He's busy right now.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Senator?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
If she held on any longer she could have.
I know.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Yes, my dear, he is.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Victor Frankenstein.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Poppycock!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
I promise.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Whatever makes you happy.
You bet your boots it does.
Darling!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
That's my good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
This is the only library I know of.
Fron kon steen!
A piece of what?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
How old are you, young man?
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
I beg your pardon?
Why are you talking like that?
What wockers?
I wonder what's got into them?
Just putting up some tea.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Could be raining!
I have a pretty good idea.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
This guy means business.
What?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Don't fall for that one.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
Ja, ja.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Are you serious??
I know Frederick.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Four
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
